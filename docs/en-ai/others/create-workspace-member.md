# How to Create a Workspace and Add Members
---

## Introduction

A workspace is designed for multi-user use, allowing for the isolation of data from different units. It also supports selecting data storage strategies for the workspace, as well as viewing, adding, and removing workspace members.

## Method/Steps

### Step 1: Create a New Workspace

In the Guance management backend under "Workspace List," click on "Create New Workspace" at the top right corner.

In the pop-up dialog box, enter the "Name," select the "Data Retention Period," "Workspace Owner," and "Workspace Administrator," then click "Confirm" to create a new workspace.

- **Workspace Owner:** Has the highest operational permissions within the workspace. They can designate "Administrators" and manage any configuration of the workspace, including upgrading the paid plan and dissolving the current workspace.
- **Workspace Administrator:** Manages the current workspace. They can set user permissions to "Read-only Member" or "Standard Member." Administrators have the authority to manage workspace configurations, including accessing the paid plan and service list; managing basic settings, member management, notification targets management; and managing data collection, disabling/enabling, editing, and deleting. However, they cannot upgrade the paid plan or dissolve the current workspace.

Note: When creating a workspace, you can temporarily leave the administrator designation blank. You can later set this in the "Workspace List" page by clicking "View Members" - "Add User."

Click on "View Members" to enter the corresponding workspace members page where you can view all basic information about the members in that space.

Click on "Add User" at the top right corner, select the members and set their permissions, then click "Confirm" to add a new member to the workspace.

**Note: Here you can only add existing system members. If it's a new system member, you need to go to "Users" - "Add User" to add them successfully before returning here to perform this operation.**
