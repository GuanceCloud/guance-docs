# How to Create a Workspace and Add Members
---

## Introduction

Workspaces are designed for multi-user environments and can isolate data from different units. They also support the selection of data retention strategies, viewing, adding, and removing workspace members.

## Method/Steps

### Step 1: Create a New Workspace

In the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> management console under "Workspace List," click on "Create Workspace" in the top-right corner.

In the dialog box that appears, enter the "Name," select the "Data Retention Period," "Workspace Owner," and "Workspace Administrator," then click "Confirm" to create a new workspace.

- **Workspace Owner:** Has the highest operational permissions within the workspace, can designate "Administrators" and manage any configuration settings, including upgrading the workspace's paid plan or dissolving the current workspace.
- **Workspace Administrator:** Manages the current workspace, can set user permissions as "Read-only Member" or "Standard Member," and has the authority to manage workspace configurations, such as accessing the paid plan and service list; performing basic settings, member management, notification targets management for the workspace; managing data collection, disabling/enabling, editing, and deleting data; does not include upgrading the workspace's paid plan or dissolving the current workspace.

Note: When creating a workspace, you may temporarily leave the workspace administrator unspecified. You can later set this in the "Workspace List" page by clicking "View Members" - "Add User."

Click "Add User" in the top-right corner, select the member and set their permissions, then click "Confirm" to add a new member to this workspace.

**Note: Here you can add existing members within the system. If it is a new system member, you need to go to "Users" - "Add User" page to add them successfully before returning here to perform this operation.**
