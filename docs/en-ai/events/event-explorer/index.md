# Explorer

Enter **Incident > Explorer** in Guance, where you can view and audit monitoring event information in one place. This allows for real-time monitoring and unified querying of events triggered by sources such as monitors, intelligent inspections, SLOs, etc.

Explorer mainly includes:

- [Unrecovered Event Explorer](./unrecovered-events.md): All ongoing unrecovered events currently triggered within the current workspace;
- [Event List](./event-list.md): A statistical list of all levels of events;
- [Event Details](./event-details.md): Includes detailed information about the event's basic attributes, extended fields, history, related events, etc.
