# Events
---

Guance provides a comprehensive event management and auditing platform, allowing real-time monitoring and unified querying of event data from various sources. By aggregating and correlating events, you can quickly pinpoint anomalies and perform efficient data analysis.

Under the **Events** feature module, you can monitor system anomalies and service quality degradation issues through modules such as monitors, intelligent inspections, SLOs, etc. **All monitoring activities result in event records**, which are then aggregated into the event analysis module for in-depth analysis and processing. This one-stop approach ensures that you have a comprehensive understanding of your system's health and can respond promptly to any potential issues.


## Where Do Events Come From?

- Alert events triggered by configurations meeting [Monitor](../monitoring/monitor/monitor-rule.md#content) and [Intelligent Monitoring](../monitoring/intelligent-monitoring/index.md) rules;
- All alert events triggered by configured [Intelligent Inspections](../monitoring/bot-obs/index.md);
- All alert events triggered by configured [SLO](../monitoring/slo.md);
- [Audit Events](../management/operation-audit.md) triggered by system operations;
- Custom events written via [OpenAPI](../open-api/keyevent/create.md).


## Viewing Event Records

- [Explorer > Unrecovered Events Explorer](./event-explorer/unrecovered-events.md): All unrecovered events within the last 48 hours in the current workspace, i.e., events with a status of not normal (`df_status != ok`).
- [Explorer > All Events Explorer](./event-explorer/event-list.md): Includes all events from sources like monitors, intelligent inspections, SLOs, audit events, and custom events written via OpenAPI. For example, each alert record triggered by a **monitor** detection rule is an event.
- [Intelligent Monitoring Events](./inte-monitoring-event.md): Includes all events triggered by configurations meeting intelligent monitoring rules; each generated alert record after triggering is an event.


## Event Content

Taking events generated by configured monitor rules as an example, the final event content primarily includes the information entered in the [New Rule > Event Notification](../monitoring/monitor/monitor-rule.md#notice) section.

As shown in the figure below, the event title is defined as `Log Detection - Multi Index`, and the DQL query statement along with variables is filled in the event content. Guance will automatically generate and display the final event record based on the actual monitored data.

When this rule detects an anomaly, you can view the relevant event details under Events > Event Details.
