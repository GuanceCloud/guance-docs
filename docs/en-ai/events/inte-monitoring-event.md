# Intelligent Monitoring
---

In the **Incident > Intelligent Monitoring** Explorer, you can view a list of all events generated by intelligent monitoring within the current workspace.

In the Intelligent Monitoring Incident Explorer, you can:

- View event counts for different rules at various time points through stacked bar charts;
- Perform keyword searches, tag filtering, field filtering, and related searches based on labels, fields, and text;
- Conduct aggregated event analysis based on selected fields.

## Query and Analysis

In the Intelligent Monitoring Incident Explorer, you can query event data using time range selection, keyword search, and filtering methods. This helps you quickly locate specific events within a certain time frame, functional module, or triggered actions.

- Time Controls: By default, all Explorers display data from the last 15 minutes. You can also customize the [time range](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#time).

- [Search and Filtering](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md)

- In the analysis panel of the Intelligent Monitoring Incident Explorer, you can perform multi-dimensional analysis based on label fields to reflect aggregated event statistics across different dimensions. Clicking on an aggregated event allows you to view [Aggregated Event Details](./event-explorer/event-details.md).

- You can edit the left-hand [Quick Filters](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#quick-filter) or add new filter fields.

- Filter History: Guance supports saving `key:value` search conditions in [Filter History](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#filter-history) for different Explorers within the current workspace.

- Event Export: In the Intelligent Monitoring Incident Explorer, click **Export** to export the current Explorer data to CSV, dashboards, and notes.

- Save Snapshot: In the top-left corner of the Intelligent Monitoring Incident Explorer, click **View Historical Snapshots** to save a snapshot of the current event data. Using the [Snapshot](../getting-started/function-details/snapshot.md) feature, you can quickly reproduce instant copies of data and restore it to a specific point in time with a particular data presentation logic.

## Event Details Page

In the Intelligent Monitoring Incident Explorer, clicking any event will slide open the event details page, which includes analysis reports, alert notifications, historical records, and related events. On the event details page, you can navigate to the associated monitors and export key event information to PDF or JSON files.
