## Renminbi Settlement and US Dollar Settlement

To meet the different needs of domestic and international customers, Guance has launched two settlement systems: [Domestic Version](https://boss.guance.com/) and [International Version](https://bill.guance.one/). The former uses Renminbi (RMB) for settlement, while the latter uses US dollars (USD). In each system, different pricing applies depending on the site you log into.
