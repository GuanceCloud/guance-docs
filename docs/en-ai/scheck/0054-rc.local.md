# 0054-rc.local-rc.local File Modified
---

## Rule ID

- 0054-rc.local


## Category

- System


## Level

- Warn


## Compatible Versions

- Linux


## Description

- Monitor the host startup loading files to check if they have been tampered with.


## Scan Frequency

- Disabled


## Theoretical Basis

- To add a program to the startup in Linux, you can typically modify `rc.local`. However, there are usually two `rc.local` files in Linux: `/etc/rc.local` (a link file) and `/etc/init.d/rc.local` (the actual file). By calculating the MD5 checksum of the file using `md5sum`, comparing the old and new checksums can reveal whether the file has been modified.


## Risk Items

- Hacker Infiltration
- Data Leakage
- Network Security
- Mining Risk
- Botnet Risk


## Audit Method

- Verify if `/etc/rc.local` on the host has been illegally modified. You can use the following command for verification:
```bash
md5sum /etc/rc.local
```


## Remediation

- If `/etc/rc.local` on the host has been illegally modified, carefully examine the host environment to determine if it has been compromised, and change the host user password.


## Impact

- Abnormal startup, enabling malicious processes, tampering with system environment variables, and executing high-risk commands.


## Default Value

- Inconsistent; adjust according to the environment.
