Guance provides users with a one-click security check function to discover malicious programs, system vulnerabilities, and security defects. Through the Security Check, you can not only promptly detect vulnerabilities and anomalies in hosts, systems, containers, and networks but also identify some routine management issues (for example, data leakage to external parties via network IO).

## Main Features

- Real-time Feedback: Supports real-time recording of vulnerabilities and anomalies in hosts, systems, containers, and networks.
- Querying Security Check Events: Supports full-text search, multi-label filtering, and viewing detailed information.
- Statistical Analysis of Security Check Events: Automatically tallies the number of security check events generated at various time points.
- Correlated Security Checks: Supports finding correlations within large datasets by matching labels of security check events.
