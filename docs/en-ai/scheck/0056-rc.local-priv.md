## Description

- Monitor whether the permissions of the host file `/etc/rc.local` have been modified.

## Theoretical Basis

- The `rc.local` script is a script that automatically runs after a Linux system boots. Additional commands that need to run at startup can be added to this script.


## Risk Items

- Function Unavailability


## Audit Method

- Run the following command and verify that Uid and Gid are both 0/root, and the permissions are 755:

```bash
stat /etc/rc.d/rc.local
Access: (0755/-rwxr-xr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```


## Remediation

- If it is detected that the `/etc/rc.local` file permissions have been changed, log in to the server as the root user to restore the permissions and audit the change.


## Impact

- None


## Default Value

- None
