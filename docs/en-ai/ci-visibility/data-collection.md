# Data Collection
---

## Introduction

Guance supports reporting the process and results of GitLab/Jenkins built-in CI to Guance for visualization. You can install DataKit, enable the GitLab/Jenkins collector, and report the results generated by the entire CI process (such as Build, Test, Deploy) to DataKit. After processing through the DataWay data gateway, the data is then reported to Guance for viewing and analysis.

## Prerequisites

You need to create a [Guance account](https://auth.guance.com/register?channel=Help%20Documentation), and install DataKit on your host [Install DataKit](../datakit/datakit-install.md).

## Data Collection

After installing DataKit, you can enable the [GitLab](../integrations/gitlab.md) / [Jenkins](../integrations/jenkins.md) collector in the DataKit installation directory. After restarting DataKit, you can obtain CI-related data.
