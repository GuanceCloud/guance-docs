In modern infrastructure, thousands of log events can be generated every minute. These logs follow specific formats, typically include timestamps, and are generated by servers. They are output to different files such as system logs, application logs, and security logs. However, these logs are currently stored分散ly on various servers, leading to the need to log in to each server separately to review logs when a system failure occurs, in order to determine the cause of the failure. This process increases the complexity of troubleshooting.

Facing such a large volume of data, you need to decide which logs should be sent to the log management solution and which should be archived. Filtering logs before sending them may result in missing critical information or accidentally deleting valuable data.

To improve the efficiency of fault diagnosis and gain a comprehensive understanding of the system status, avoiding passive responses in emergencies, it is crucial to achieve centralized log management and provide centralized search and correlation analysis functions.

Guance, through its powerful log collection capabilities, allows you to report log data uniformly to the Guance workspace. In this way, you can centrally store, audit, monitor, alert, analyze, and export collected log data, thereby simplifying the log management process.

By doing so, Guance helps you avoid potential issues caused by filtering logs before sending them, ensuring that all critical information is properly handled and analyzed.


## Functional Modules


<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- [:material-clipboard-text-search:{ .lg .middle } __Query & Analysis__](explorer.md)

    ---
    
    Automatically identify log status, quickly filter and correlate logs, aggregate similar texts, helping to rapidly discover and analyze incidents, accelerating troubleshooting

- [:material-book-arrow-down-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Pipelines__](../pipeline/index.md)

    ---

    Parse the text content of logs, converting them into structured data, including extracting timestamps, statuses, and specific fields as labels

- [:fontawesome-brands-atlassian:{ .lg .middle } __Generate Metrics__](generate-metrics.md)

    ---

    Generate new metric data based on existing data within the current workspace, facilitating the design and implementation of new technical metrics as needed

- [:material-calendar-text-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Log Indexing__](./multi-index/index.md)

    ---

    Archive log data that meets certain conditions in different indices and select data storage strategies for log indices

- [:material-filter-multiple:{ .lg .middle } __Log Blacklist__](../management/overall-blacklist.md)  

    ---

    Customize filtering rules for log collection; log data that meets the criteria will not be reported to Guance, helping to save log data storage costs

- [:material-clipboard-check-multiple-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Data Forwarding__](../management/backup/index.md)
    
    ---

    Save log, trace, and user access data to object storage in Guance or forward it to external storage, managing data forwarding flexibly

- [:material-database-check:{ .lg .middle } __Data Access__](../management/logdata-access.md)

    ---

    Control log data access more precisely by setting role-based access permissions and data masking rules, while handling sensitive information appropriately
