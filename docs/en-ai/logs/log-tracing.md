# Error Tracing

The Log Error Tracing Explorer is designed to present all error log data collected by Guance. This explorer filters and displays log entries containing the `error_stack` or `error_message` fields, enabling you to perform precise queries and in-depth analysis.

## Error List

In the error tracing list, you can inspect error information within a specific time range. You can also use the quick filters on the left side to filter data according to your business needs, or enter filtering conditions in the search bar to quickly locate the required data.

- View detailed information related to the `error` data, such as its source and involved services;
- Use the error distribution chart to visually understand changes in error trends;
- View extended field information associated with this data entry;
- Browse context logs related to this data for additional background information.
