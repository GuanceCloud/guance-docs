# Guance SaaS Service Level Agreement
---

This Service Level Agreement (Service Level Agreement, hereinafter referred to as "SLA") stipulates the service availability level indicators and compensation plans for the Guance SaaS services provided by Guance to users.

1. Definitions

1.1 Service Period: A service period is one calendar month. If a user uses Guance SaaS services for less than one month, the cumulative usage time of Guance SaaS services in that month will be considered as one service period.

1.2 Total Minutes in Service Period: Calculated as total days in the service period × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

1.3 Service Instance: A workspace created by the user on the Guance SaaS site.

1.4 Unavailable Minutes: If all attempts by the user to establish a connection with the specified Guance SaaS service instance fail continuously for 5 minutes (or longer), this period will be regarded as unavailable. The sum of unavailable minutes for a single Guance SaaS service instance within a service period is the total unavailable minutes.

1.5 Monthly Service Fee: The cash payment portion of the bill generated by a single Guance SaaS service instance in one calendar month (excluding gifted vouchers, discount coupons, etc.).

2. Service Availability

2.1 Calculation Formula for Service Availability

Service availability is calculated per service instance as follows:

Service Availability = (Total minutes in service period - Unavailable minutes) / Total minutes in service period × 100%

2.2 Service Availability Commitment

The service availability of Guance SaaS services is no less than 99.90%, meaning the unavailable duration per month ≤ 43.2 minutes. If the service availability commitment for a Guance SaaS service instance is not met, users can receive compensation according to Article 4 of this agreement.

3. Service Unavailability

3.1 Scenarios of Service Unavailability

(1) Inability to log into Guance (SaaS site) or display pages for more than 5 consecutive minutes due to reasons other than the user's own network or equipment;

(2) Data query failures (API returns 5xx error codes) for various data explorers, views, monitors, etc., for more than 5 consecutive minutes due to reasons other than the user's own network or equipment;

(3) Monitors not operating normally according to configured rules for more than 15 minutes;

(4) Data write failure rates exceeding 15% for more than 10 consecutive minutes due to issues with Guance's fault (excluding DataKit configuration issues such as type conflicts caused by inconsistent field slicing before and after Pipeline);

(5) Interfaces receiving 5xx errors for more than 10 consecutive minutes when reporting data from the official Guance-compiled DataKit data collector due to reasons other than the user's own network or equipment.

3.2 Exclusions

The following scenarios leading to service unavailability are not counted towards service unavailability time:

(1) System maintenance notified by Guance at least 12 hours in advance during working hours, including but not limited to maintenance, optimization, and planned availability fluctuations of devices, systems, software services, cutover, maintenance, simulation drills, etc.;

(2) Failures or configuration adjustments outside the network and equipment on which Guance services depend;

(3) Incidents caused by recognized hacker attacks on the user's application after both parties' confirmation;

(4) Incidents caused by improper maintenance or confidentiality leading to loss or leakage of data, passwords, credentials, etc.;

(5) Incidents caused by user negligence or authorized operations;

(6) Incidents caused by the user not following Guance product documentation or usage recommendations;

(7) Significant increases in user data traffic (exceeding 100% growth over the same hour of the previous workday, with a minimum increase of 50 million documents, including logs, traces, RUM, events, dial testing, infrastructure, etc.) without prior written notice to Guance, resulting in reduced availability;

(8) Other force majeure incidents (service fees incurred by these incidents do not need to be paid by users).

4. Compensation Plan

4.1 Compensation Standards

Each Guance SaaS service instance calculates compensation vouchers based on its monthly service availability using the standards in Table 5, with the amount of compensation vouchers not exceeding 100% of the monthly service fee paid by the user in the month where the service availability commitment was not met.

4.2 Compensation Application Deadline

Users can apply for compensation for instances that did not meet the service availability commitment in the previous month starting from the fifth (5) business day of each natural month. Compensation applications should not be later than two (2) months after the end of the relevant month in which the Guance SaaS service did not meet the service availability commitment, either via ticket or email.

5. Others

Service Availability Compensation Standards

| Availability Range | Compensation Standard |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 99.00% ≤ Service Availability < 99.90% | 15% of Monthly Service Fee |
| 95.00% ≤ Service Availability < 99.00% | 30% of Monthly Service Fee |
| Service Availability < 95.00% | 100% of Monthly Service Fee |

Guance reserves the right to modify this SLA. Any modifications to this SLA will be notified to you 3 days in advance via website announcements or email.

Based on the Trusted Cloud data storage durability formula P = 1-u*{[1-(1-u’)<sup>w</sup>]}<sup>n-1</sup>

Guance data storage durability P = 1-0.3%*{[1-(1-0.0125%)<sup>1</sup>]}<sup>(3-1)</sup> ≈ 99.999999995%

Formula Explanation:

- n: n=3, each piece of data has 3 replicas
- u: u=2/12/50*100%=0.3%, disk monthly failure rate is 0.3%
- u': u'=2/12/24/50*100%=0.0125%, disk hourly failure rate is 0.0125%
- w: Data recovery time w hours, w = detection time + recovery time = 15 minutes + 45 minutes = 1 hour
