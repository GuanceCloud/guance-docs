# Guance SaaS Service Level Agreement
---

Effective Date: August 20, 2024

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) specifies the service availability metrics and compensation plan for the Guance SaaS services provided by Guance to users.

1. Definitions

1.1 Service Period: A service period is one calendar month. If a user uses the Guance SaaS service for less than a month, the cumulative usage time of the Guance SaaS service in that month will be considered as one service period.

1.2 Total Minutes in Service Period: Calculated as the total number of days in the service period × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

1.3 Service Instance: A "workspace" created by the user on the Guance SaaS site.

1.4 Unavailable Minutes: If all attempts to establish a connection with a specified Guance SaaS service instance fail continuously for 5 minutes (or longer), or if multiple services fail simultaneously for more than 15 minutes, this period is considered unavailable. The sum of unavailable minutes for a single Guance SaaS service instance within a service period is the total unavailable minutes.

1.5 Monthly Service Fee: The cash payment portion of the billing fees generated by a single Guance SaaS service instance in one calendar month (excluding gift vouchers, discount coupons, etc.).

2. Service Availability

2.1 Calculation Formula for Service Availability

Service availability is calculated per service instance as follows:

Service Availability = (Total Minutes in Service Period - Unavailable Minutes) / Total Minutes in Service Period × 100%

2.2 Service Availability Commitment

Guance SaaS service availability will be no less than 99.90%, meaning the monthly unavailability duration ≤ 43.2 minutes. If the Guance SaaS service instance does not meet this availability commitment, users can receive compensation according to Article 4 of this agreement.

3. Service Unavailability

3.1 Scenarios Considered as Service Unavailability

(1) Inability to log in to the Guance SaaS site or display pages continuously for more than 5 minutes due to reasons other than the user's own network or device issues;

(2) Data query failures (API returns 5xx error codes) for various data explorers, views, monitors, etc., lasting more than 5 minutes due to reasons other than the user's own network or device issues;

(3) Monitors failing to operate normally as configured for more than 15 minutes;

(4) Data write failure rates exceeding 15% for more than 10 minutes due to faults in Guance (excluding DataKit configuration issues like type conflicts caused by inconsistent field splitting in Pipeline);

(5) DataKit data collectors officially compiled and released by Guance receiving 5xx errors continuously for more than 10 minutes when uploading data after normal login;

(6) After logging into Guance and performing standard queries on saved content, the system fails to return content normally within 5 minutes, including incomplete, irregular displays, timeout errors, or other error messages.

3.2 Exclusions

The following scenarios leading to service unavailability are not counted toward unavailable time:

(1) System maintenance notified at least 12 hours in advance during working hours, including but not limited to equipment, system, software service inspections, maintenance, optimization, and planned availability fluctuations (up to 120 minutes during workdays and up to 240 minutes outside workdays; additional explanations and user confirmation required for longer periods);

(2) Failures or configuration adjustments outside the network and devices on which Guance services depend;

(3) Issues caused by confirmed hacker attacks on user applications;

(4) Issues caused by improper maintenance or confidentiality breaches leading to data, passwords, or credentials being lost or leaked;

(5) Issues caused by user negligence or authorized operations;

(6) Issues caused by users not following product documentation or usage recommendations;

(7) Large-scale traffic surges (exceeding 100% growth over the same hour of the previous workday, with a minimum increase of 50 million documents, including logs, traces, RUM, events, dial testing, infrastructure, etc.) without prior written notice to Guance;

(8) Other force majeure events (users are also not responsible for service fees incurred due to these events).

4. Compensation Plan

4.1 Compensation Standards

For each Guance SaaS service instance, compensation service vouchers are calculated based on the monthly service availability as shown in Table 5, with the voucher amount not exceeding 100% of the monthly service fee paid by the user for the month in question.

4.2 Compensation Application Deadline

Users can submit compensation claims for instances that did not meet the service availability commitment in the previous month starting from the fifth (5th) working day of each calendar month. Claims must be submitted via ticket or email no later than two (2) months after the end of the relevant month.

5. Other

Service availability compensation standards

| Availability Range | Compensation Standard |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 99.00% ≤ Service Availability < 99.90% | 15% of Monthly Service Fee |
| 95.00% ≤ Service Availability < 99.00% | 30% of Monthly Service Fee |
| Service Availability < 95.00% | 100% of Monthly Service Fee |

Guance reserves the right to modify the terms of this SLA. Any modifications to this SLA will be notified at least 3 days in advance via website announcements or email.
