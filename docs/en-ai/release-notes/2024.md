# Change Log (2024)

---

## December 25, 2024

### OpenAPI Updates {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports fetching a list of resource catalogs, and supports [creation](../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modification](../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[deletion](../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[export](../open-api/objc-set/export.md) of resource Explorers.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metrics, and supports [creation](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modification](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enable/disable](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[deletion](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) of metrics.

### Feature Updates {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automatic writing of [Pipeline](../pipeline/index.md): Traditional log parsing methods often rely on familiarity with rules for manual script writing, which not only consumes a lot of time but also easily leads to errors, reducing the efficiency of writing Pipelines and inability to respond and solve problems in a timely manner. To improve efficiency and reduce labor costs, this feature leverages large models' natural language processing capabilities to assist in automating log content parsing, helping developers write Pipelines more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large volumes of logs, simplifying data flows and processing.

#### Monitoring

AI alert compression and merging: By using large models to compress and merge monitoring alert events, it reduces redundancy, especially when a system generates a large number of alerts within a short period. Through event consolidation, it ensures that operation personnel receive only one comprehensive alert message within a specified time cycle (e.g., 10 minutes), rather than multiple duplicate alerts.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

Cloud billing scenario view, Explorer added consumption currency category display.

#### Scenarios

1. Dashboards, built-in views added [ID identifier](../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely determined by an ID identifier. When configuring jump links within charts, the ID can be used to locate dashboards or user views.
2. Explorer [auto-refresh](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#refresh) logic adjustment: Removed the "pause" button in the time component, added "off" option in the refresh frequency options, allowing users to turn off auto-refresh as needed, making operations simpler and more intuitive. Also removed the "Explorer auto-refresh" switch in personal settings to avoid redundant functionality and optimize the user experience.
3. Added function `MD5()` to Explorer, supporting querying log data masked with MD5 encryption.
4. Chart optimization: Charts now support obtaining PromQL metric names for legends and using `{__name__}` to configure aliases for metric names.
5. PromQL editor added syntax highlighting and syntax hints.

#### Metrics

[Generate Metrics](../metrics/generate-metrics.md) improvements:

1. Consolidated all types of generated metrics under the Metrics catalog for easier viewing and management.
2. Supported re-aggregation of existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing more dimensions for data analysis.

#### Management

Optimized application of data access and sensitive data viewing desensitization rules: Optimized multi-rule and multi-role combination overlay data viewing scope. If members have multiple roles, the final data access scope is the union of the defined ranges in the rules, and the same applies to sensitive data viewing desensitization rules.

#### Infrastructure

Resource Catalog [cross-workspace query](../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace): In the Resource Catalog menu, cross-workspace queries for resource list data are supported.

### Deployment Plan Updates {#deployment1225}

1. Deployment Plan supports [customizing navigation bar and action button display text](../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Backend member menu optimizations:

   - Added "Login Type" column, supporting differentiation between default login members and SSO login members, and allowing filtering by login type;
   - For SSO login members, editing of "Other Attributes" fields is supported, allowing customization of attribute information. This information will be synchronized to Webhook externally and the corresponding event content area when sending alerts.

3. Workspaces with primary storage engines as Volcengine, link, log, and custom log index storage policies are adjusted to: standard storage, infrequent storage, archive storage. Each can be configured for hot data, infrequent data, and archive data retention periods. Additionally, if the primary storage engine is Volcengine, when creating a new index in the Guance console, the storage policy is also adjusted to: standard storage, infrequent storage, archive storage.

### New Integrations {#inte1225}

#### Scenarios

1. [Topology Map](../scene/visual-chart/topology-map.md) added external data query: Allows users to visualize topology maps through DataFlux Func by connecting external data. Users only need to connect data according to the chart structure to achieve external data visualization.
2. [Chart](../scene/visual-chart/index.md#type) optimizations
   - Chart display effect optimization: Improved chart display effect, adjusted to slide-out listing, categorized display, making chart search and use more convenient.
   - Added chart descriptions and applicable scenarios to help users better understand and select appropriate chart types.
3. View variable optimization
   - Added configuration value listing limit to prevent excessive data leading to page loading performance issues.
   - Default listing limit for deployment plan is 50, supports custom default listing quantity. Note: Page configuration limits take precedence over global limits.

#### RUM

RUM added support for React Native app types and allows uploading SourceMap for data parsing and restoration. If you need to upload SourceMap for React Native apps originally created under Android / iOS types, please note:

1. When creating a new app, choose the "React Native" app type. During creation, you can directly copy the name and app ID of an existing React Native app under Android / iOS types, then click the "Create" button. After creation, you can configure SourceMap under this app. This change only affects the creation method of React Native apps and does not impact data collection.

2. If your original React Native app under Android / iOS types has associated monitors and you have not recreated the same ID React Native app under the "React Native" type, the existing monitors can continue to work normally. However, if you have recreated the "React Native" type app, the "Application Name" item in the existing monitor will not get data and will show as empty. In this case, you need to select "React Native" as the app type and save the monitor again.

#### APM

APM installation guide added [automatic injection method](../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM (APM) installation guide, a Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method was added. This method simplifies the APM deployment process, allowing users to install and use it more quickly in Kubernetes environments.

### Breaking Changes {#breakingchanges0925}

Dial Testing Labels: Field name changed from `tags.info` to `df_label`.

### Feature Updates {#feature0925}

#### Scenarios

1. Dashboards added [historical version records](../scene/dashboard/history-version.md): You can view version records saved for this dashboard over the past three months. Selecting a version allows you to view the chart details of that version, and changes can be marked in JSON format with different colors.
   - Supports restoring the current dashboard to a selected historical version;
   - Supports cloning a specific version of the dashboard.
2. [Custom Explorer](../scene/explorer/custom-explorer.md) supports changing the display column order: When editing custom Explorer configurations, you can drag and drop selected fields to change the display order of the fields.

#### Monitoring

Monitors added custom operation permissions: After configuring operation permissions, only authorized objects can perform enable/disable, edit, and delete actions on the monitor.

- Note: If no operation permissions are configured, the monitor permissions follow the default permissions for "Monitor Configuration Management".

#### User Access Monitoring

1. Session Replay Enhancement: Launched session replay functionality for mobile applications, supporting the replay of user behavior trails and troubleshooting usage issues on mobile devices.
2. Data Access Enhancement: User access added [data access](../real-user-monitoring/rumdata_access.md) functionality, supporting configuration of data viewing scopes at the application level, enabling fine-grained management of member data query boundaries.

#### Management

1. Cross-Space Authorization Optimization: Changed the definition of the login space to "current space" to simplify operations between different spaces.
2. [Data Forwarding Rules](../management/backup/index.md) support specifying storage directories: When the archival type is AWS S3, Huawei Cloud OBS, or Alibaba Cloud OSS, you can forward data to the corresponding directories within the storage bucket, helping better manage forwarded data.
   - Note: Please exercise caution when changing storage paths. Due to a delay of about 5 minutes in updating configurations, some data may still be forwarded to the original directory after changes.
3. Data Forwarding Explorer Optimization:
   - Time Control Adjustment: Changed to the general time control used by Explorers, allowing retrieval of forwarded data accurate to the minute.
   - SLS Query Logstore Data Storage Location Adjustment: "Data Forwarding" no longer retains SLS query logstore data, which can be queried in the "Log Explorer".

#### Synthetic Tests

If the label format is `key:value`, in the results, the `key` value will be extracted to a top-level field.

- Note: If a custom label key conflicts with other dial test result attributes, it will be discarded.

#### Infrastructure

1. [Resource Catalog](../infrastructure/custom/index.md) Function Enhancement: Optimized the resource catalog architecture, supporting user-defined resource Explorer templates and providing list and honeycomb chart views to enhance the viewing and analysis experience of resource data.
2. Container Interaction Optimization: When switching views in container and K8s infrastructure Explorers, the filtering and search conditions
