### Intelligent Inspection Updates

- New Inspections

    - Cloud Idle Resource Inspection: With the rapid development of cloud computing as a new IT service method, it provides convenient, fast, and flexible IT infrastructure and application services for enterprises and individuals, bringing high efficiency and economic benefits. However, as cloud resources gradually become the main component of enterprise data centers, the significant waste of cloud resources becomes increasingly evident. Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and departmental isolation, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming a large number of idle resources. This situation can lead to a sharp increase in cloud service costs, reduced resource efficiency, and may lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize idle cloud resources, improving the use benefits and resource utilization rate of cloud computing, performing cloud idle resource inspections is very necessary. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in current cloud services can be discovered and handled in a timely manner, avoiding unnecessary expenses, data leaks, poor performance, and other issues caused by long-term unnecessary resource usage.
    - Host Reboot Inspection: Host abnormal reboot monitoring is an important part of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When hosts experience abnormal reboots, it can lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss, impacting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, system complexity also increases, leading to higher probabilities of issues. Therefore, using relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal reboots can help businesses diagnose problems quickly, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.

#### New Inspections

- **RUM Performance Inspection:** Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an application performance monitoring technology aimed at evaluating website performance by simulating real-user browsing behavior. The goal of RUM is to understand website performance from the user's perspective, including load times, page rendering effects, element loading situations, and interaction responses. RUM performance inspection is mainly used for client-type websites such as e-commerce sites, financial sites, entertainment sites, etc., which require presenting a fast and smooth user experience. Analyzing RUM performance results can quickly help developers understand actual user experiences for rapid improvement of website performance.
- **Kubernetes Health Inspection:** Nowadays, Kubernetes has swept the container ecosystem, serving as the brain of distributed container deployments. It manages service-oriented applications using containers distributed across host clusters. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updates, service discovery, and scaling. However, how do we ensure the health of Kubernetes nodes? Through intelligent inspections, we can retrieve and discover issues based on current node resource status, application performance management, and service failure logs, thus accelerating incident investigation, reducing engineer pressure, minimizing mean time to repair, and improving end-user experience.

### Intelligent Inspection Updates

- New Inspections

    - Cloud Idle Resource Inspection: With the rapid development of cloud computing as a new IT service method, it provides convenient, fast, and flexible IT infrastructure and application services for enterprises and individuals, bringing high efficiency and economic benefits. However, as cloud resources gradually become the main component of enterprise data centers, the significant waste of cloud resources becomes increasingly evident. Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and departmental isolation, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming a large number of idle resources. This situation can lead to a sharp increase in cloud service costs, reduced resource efficiency, and may lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize idle cloud resources, improving the use benefits and resource utilization rate of cloud computing, performing cloud idle resource inspections is very necessary. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in current cloud services can be discovered and handled in a timely manner, avoiding unnecessary expenses, data leaks, poor performance, and other issues caused by long-term unnecessary resource usage.
    - Host Reboot Inspection: Host abnormal reboot monitoring is an important part of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When hosts experience abnormal reboots, it can lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss, impacting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, system complexity also increases, leading to higher probabilities of issues. Therefore, using relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal reboots can help businesses diagnose problems quickly, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.

- The old version's failed disk cache, due to performance issues, has been replaced with a new implementation. The new implementation's binary format is incompatible with the old one. If upgrading, old data will not be recognized. It is recommended to manually delete old cache data (old data may affect the new version's disk cache) before upgrading to the new version of Datakit. Despite this, the new version's disk cache remains experimental and should be used cautiously.
- Datakit's own metric system was updated, resulting in some missing metrics obtained by the original DCA, but this does not affect the operation of DCA itself.

For more DataKit updates, refer to **DataKit Version History**.

The goal of RUM is to understand website performance from the user's perspective, including load times, page rendering effects, element loading situations, and interaction responses. RUM performance inspection is mainly used for client-type websites such as e-commerce sites, financial sites, entertainment sites, etc., which require presenting a fast and smooth user experience. Analyzing RUM performance results can quickly help developers understand actual user experiences for rapid improvement of website performance.
- **Kubernetes Health Inspection:** Nowadays, Kubernetes has swept the container ecosystem, serving as the brain of distributed container deployments. It manages service-oriented applications using containers distributed across host clusters. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updates, service discovery, and scaling. However, how do we ensure the health of Kubernetes nodes? Through intelligent inspections, we can retrieve and discover issues based on current node resource status, application performance management, and service failure logs, thus accelerating incident investigation, reducing engineer pressure, minimizing mean time to repair, and improving end-user experience.

Refer to the **Intelligent Inspection Update Log** for more intelligent inspection updates.

Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and departmental isolation, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming a large number of idle resources. This situation can lead to a sharp increase in cloud service costs, reduced resource efficiency, and may lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize idle cloud resources, improving the use benefits and resource utilization rate of cloud computing, performing cloud idle resource inspections is very necessary. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in current cloud services can be discovered and handled in a timely manner, avoiding unnecessary expenses, data leaks, poor performance, and other issues caused by long-term unnecessary resource usage.
    - Host Reboot Inspection: Host abnormal reboot monitoring is an important part of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When hosts experience abnormal reboots, it can lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss, impacting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, system complexity also increases, leading to higher probabilities of issues. Therefore, using relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal reboots can help businesses diagnose problems quickly, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.

### Intelligent Inspection Updates

- New Inspections

    - Cloud Idle Resource Inspection: With the rapid development of cloud computing as a new IT service method, it provides convenient, fast, and flexible IT infrastructure and application services for enterprises and individuals, bringing high efficiency and economic benefits. However, as cloud resources gradually become the main component of enterprise data centers, the significant waste of cloud resources becomes increasingly evident. Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and departmental isolation, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming a large number of idle resources. This situation can lead to a sharp increase in cloud service costs, reduced resource efficiency, and may lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize idle cloud resources, improving the use benefits and resource utilization rate of cloud computing, performing cloud idle resource inspections is very necessary. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in current cloud services can be discovered and handled in a timely manner, avoiding unnecessary expenses, data leaks, poor performance, and other issues caused by long-term unnecessary resource usage.
    - Host Reboot Inspection: Host abnormal reboot monitoring is an important part of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When hosts experience abnormal reboots, it can lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss, impacting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, system complexity also increases, leading to higher probabilities of issues. Therefore, using relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal reboots can help businesses diagnose problems quickly, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.

RUM performance inspection is mainly used for client-type websites such as e-commerce sites, financial sites, entertainment sites, etc., which require presenting a fast and smooth user experience. Analyzing RUM performance results can quickly help developers understand actual user experiences for rapid improvement of website performance.
- **Kubernetes Health Inspection**: Nowadays, Kubernetes has swept the container ecosystem, serving as the brain of distributed container deployments. It manages service-oriented applications using containers distributed across host clusters. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updates, service discovery, and scaling. However, how do we ensure the health of Kubernetes nodes? Through intelligent inspections, we can retrieve and discover issues based on current node resource status, application performance management, and service failure logs, thus accelerating incident investigation, reducing engineer pressure, minimizing mean time to repair, and improving end-user experience.

### Intelligent Inspection Updates

- New Inspections

    - Cloud Idle Resource Inspection: With the rapid development of cloud computing as a new IT service method, it provides convenient, fast, and flexible IT infrastructure and application services for enterprises and individuals, bringing high efficiency and economic benefits. However, as cloud resources gradually become the main component of enterprise data centers, the significant waste of cloud resources becomes increasingly evident. Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and departmental isolation, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming a large number of idle resources. This situation can lead to a sharp increase in cloud service costs, reduced resource efficiency, and may lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize idle cloud resources, improving the use benefits and resource utilization rate of cloud computing, performing cloud idle resource inspections is very necessary. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in current cloud services can be discovered and handled in a timely manner, avoiding unnecessary expenses, data leaks, poor performance, and other issues caused by long-term unnecessary resource usage.
    - Host Reboot Inspection: Host abnormal reboot monitoring is an important part of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When hosts experience abnormal reboots, it can lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss, impacting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, system complexity also increases, leading to higher probabilities of issues. Therefore, using relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal reboots can help businesses diagnose problems quickly, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.

### Intelligent Inspection Update

#### New Inspections

- **RUM Performance Inspection**: Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an application performance monitoring technology aimed at evaluating website performance by simulating real-user browsing behavior. The goal of RUM is to understand website performance from the user's perspective, including load times, page rendering effects, element loading situations, and interaction responses. RUM performance inspection is mainly used for client-type websites such as e-commerce sites, financial sites, entertainment sites, etc., which require presenting a fast and smooth user experience. Analyzing RUM performance results can quickly help developers understand actual user experiences for rapid improvement of website performance.
- **Kubernetes Health Inspection**: Nowadays, Kubernetes has swept the container ecosystem, serving as the brain of distributed container deployments. It manages service-oriented applications using containers distributed across host clusters. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updates, service discovery, and scaling. However, how do we ensure the health of Kubernetes nodes? Through intelligent inspections, we can retrieve and discover issues based on current node resource status, application performance management, and service failure logs, thus accelerating incident investigation, reducing engineer pressure, minimizing mean time to repair, and improving end-user experience.

Refer to the **Intelligent Inspection Update Log** for more intelligent inspection updates.

### Intelligent Inspection Updates

- New Inspections

    - Cloud Idle Resource Inspection: With the rapid development of cloud computing as a new IT service method, it provides convenient, fast, and flexible IT infrastructure and application services for enterprises and individuals, bringing high efficiency and economic benefits. However, as cloud resources gradually become the main component of enterprise data centers, the significant waste of cloud resources becomes increasingly evident. Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and departmental isolation, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming a large number of idle resources. This situation can lead to a sharp increase in cloud service costs, reduced resource efficiency, and may lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize idle cloud resources, improving the use benefits and resource utilization rate of cloud computing, performing cloud idle resource inspections is very necessary. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in current cloud services can be discovered and handled in a timely manner, avoiding unnecessary expenses, data leaks, poor performance, and other issues caused by long-term unnecessary resource usage.
    - Host Reboot Inspection: Host abnormal reboot monitoring is an important part of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When hosts experience abnormal reboots, it can lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss, impacting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, system complexity also increases, leading to higher probabilities of issues. Therefore, using relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal reboots can help businesses diagnose problems quickly, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.

### Intelligent Inspection Updates

- New Inspections

    - Cloud Idle Resource Inspection: With the rapid development of cloud computing as a new IT service method, it provides convenient, fast, and flexible IT infrastructure and application services for enterprises and individuals, bringing high efficiency and economic benefits. However, as cloud resources gradually become the main component of enterprise data centers, the significant waste of cloud resources becomes increasingly evident. Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and departmental isolation, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming a large number of idle resources. This situation can lead to a sharp increase in cloud service costs, reduced resource efficiency, and may lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize idle cloud resources, improving the use benefits and resource utilization rate of cloud computing, performing cloud idle resource inspections is very necessary. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in current cloud services can be discovered and handled in a timely manner, avoiding unnecessary expenses, data leaks, poor performance, and other issues caused by long-term unnecessary resource usage.
    - Host Reboot Inspection: Host abnormal reboot monitoring is an important part of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When hosts experience abnormal reboots, it can lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss, impacting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, system complexity also increases, leading to higher probabilities of issues. Therefore, using relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal reboots can help businesses diagnose problems quickly, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.
