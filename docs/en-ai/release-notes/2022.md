## December 29, 2022

### Guance Updates

#### New MFA Authentication Management

Guance provides MFA authentication management to add an extra layer of security protection beyond account usernames and passwords. When MFA authentication is enabled, you need to perform secondary verification during login to enhance your account's security. For more details, refer to the document **MFA Management**.

#### New Workspace IP Access Login Whitelist

Guance supports configuring an IP whitelist for workspaces to restrict visitor users. After enabling the IP whitelist, only IPs from the whitelist can log in normally, and all other requests will be denied access. For more details, refer to the document **IP Whitelist**.

Note: Only administrators and owners can set the IP whitelist. At the same time, "owners" are not restricted by the IP whitelist.

#### New Service Network Topology

In K8S environments, you can use the Service network topology to view request relationships, response times, error rates, etc., between various Services in the K8S environment. When a Service connection issue is detected, you can click to view the logs corresponding to that Service to locate its problem. For more details, refer to the document **Service Network**.

- Optimize Windows installation and upgrade commands for Datakit
- Optimize Pythond encapsulation
- Provide detailed operation error messages for Pipelines

For more DataKit updates, refer to **DataKit Version History**.

### Intelligent Inspection Updates

#### Official Intelligent Inspection Discontinued

Official intelligent inspections for "Memory Leaks", "Application Performance Detection", and "Disk Usage Rate" have been discontinued today. Users can configure inspections using self-built inspection scripts.

#### New Cloud Account Instance Dimension Bill Inspection

Cloud account instance dimension bill inspection helps users manage abnormal cost warnings for cloud service instances, predict costs, and provide high-growth and high-consumption instance prompts and bill visualization capabilities, supporting multi-dimensional visualized consumption situations for cloud service resources.

#### New AliCloud Preemptible Instance Survival Inspection

Due to fluctuations in market prices for preemptible instances, it is necessary to specify a bidding model when creating a preemptible instance. If the real-time market price of the specified instance specification is lower than the bid and inventory is sufficient, the creation of a preemptible instance will succeed. Therefore, preemptive instance inspections for cloud assets are particularly important. Through inspections, when it is found that a preemptible instance is about to be released, it will prompt the latest price of all available zones for the current specification of the preemptible instance and provide appropriate handling suggestions based on historical prices.

For more intelligent inspection updates, refer to **Intelligent Inspection Update Logs**.

## December 15, 2022

### Guance Updates

#### New Profile and Network Billing

Guance has added new billing items for Profile and Network. Profile counts the number of application performance Profiles reported in the workspace on the current day, and Network counts the number of hosts (host) with network data reported in the workspace on the current day. For more details, refer to the document **Billing Method**.

#### Simplified Registration Process for Guance

Guance has simplified the registration process to help you complete registration and start using Guance quickly. For more details, refer to the document **Register Commercial Plan**.

#### New Warroom Feature

Guance provides a "Warroom" dashboard where you can overview key metric trends across all workspaces, helping you quickly understand critical data conditions in each workspace and promptly identify and resolve abnormal issues. For more details, refer to the document **Key Metric Management**.

#### New Dashboard Carousel Functionality

Guance offers carousel functionality for multiple related business dashboards. Once set up, you can display them on large screens. For more details, refer to the document **Carousel Dashboards**.

#### Binding External SLS Index for Workspace

Guance now supports binding SLS indexes to help you quickly view and analyze your log data. Guance also supports field mapping functions to help you map SLS index fields for cluster analysis. For more details, refer to the document **Log Index**.

![](img/7.log_index_1.png)

#### Link Viewer Chart Display Optimization

In the link viewer, new trend charts for "Span Count" and "Error Span Count" have been added. You can quickly view trends for Span count, Error Span count, request count, Error request count, and response time through the chart in the viewer.

### Intelligent Inspection Updates

#### New Guidance Page for Intelligent Inspections

Guance default supports three intelligent inspection templates: memory leaks, disk usage rate, and application performance detection. After this update, existing workspaces support manually deleting default intelligent inspection templates, while new workspaces no longer provide these three intelligent inspections by default, adding a beginner guidance prompt.
