# Network

---

The network module supports viewing network traffic between hosts, Pods, Deployments, and Services. Based on server-side and client-side perspectives, it displays the network traffic and data connection status from source IP to destination IP in real-time through visualization. This helps enterprises understand the network operation status of their business systems in real-time, quickly analyze, track, and locate issues, and prevent or avoid business problems caused by decreased network performance or interruptions.

Guance's network module includes three main sections: [Summary](#host), [Service Map](#map), and [Network Flow](#netflow), providing a comprehensive analysis of real-time network data.

## Prerequisites

You need to first register and log in to Guance, and then [install DataKit](../datakit/datakit-install.md) on your host, enabling the [eBPF collector](../integrations/ebpf.md).

### Network Path

Using the host network as an example, you can view network traffic and data connection status between client and server endpoints in the list, including client, server, TCP retransmissions, TCP connections, TCP closures, TCP delay, sent bytes, received bytes, etc.

Clicking on settings allows you to customize the displayed columns:

**Note**: Custom display field changes are user-level and not globally saved.

### Analysis Charts

On the current host network summary page, you can view trend charts for different [parameters](#concepts) over various time periods.

![](img/net-3.png)

### Quick Filters

On the summary pageâ€™s left side, quick filters mainly include transmission direction, transmission protocol, host, PID, and fields related to clients and servers:

![](img/net-4.png)

???+ info "Combination of Transmission Direction and Protocol"

    Currently supports network performance monitoring based on TCP and UDP protocols. Combined with incoming and outgoing, there are six combination options:

    incoming + no protocol distinction  
    incoming + TCP protocol  
    incoming + UDP protocol  
    outgoing + no protocol distinction  
    outgoing + TCP protocol  
    outgoing + UDP protocol  

### Time Widget {#widget}

In summary mode, the time widget allows you to control the data display range as needed. You can quickly select built-in time ranges or set custom time ranges.

![](img/net-5.png)

> For more details, refer to [How to Use the Time Widget](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#time).

### List Details

Taking the host network as an example, after successful data collection, host network data is reported to the Guance console. Clicking on a network data entry in the list opens the details page where you can view all network performance monitoring data within the workspace, including top-level client-server transmission directions, analysis charts, and network connection analysis.

![](img/net-6.png)

To avoid query failures due to excessive return results, you can choose to aggregate data by IP dimension.

![](img/net-8.png)

???+ warning

    - Currently only supports Linux systems, and except for CentOS 7.6+ and Ubuntu 16.04, other distributions require a Linux kernel version higher than 4.0.0;

    - Host network traffic data is retained for the last 48 hours by default, while Free Plan retains data for the last 24 hours;

    - In the host detail page, clicking into **Network**, the [time widget](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#time) defaults to fetching the last 15 minutes of data and does not support automatic refresh; manual refresh is required.

> The detail page also includes other operations such as time widgets, search, binding built-in views, export, etc. Refer to [Effective Use of Detail Pages](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md).

#### Pod, Deployment, and Service Data Details

In the detail page, you can view the corresponding object names and switch between L4 and L7 networks for data viewing.

#### Network Connection Analysis {#connect}

In the detail page > Network Connection Analysis, you can further view network connection data, including client, server, transmission direction, sent bytes, received bytes, TCP delay, TCP retransmissions, etc.

Additionally, you can customize the displayed fields via the **Settings** button or add filter conditions for keyword fields. To view more detailed network connection data, click on the data to view its corresponding network flow data.

## Service Map {#map}

Click into **Infrastructure > Network > Service Map** to view the upstream and downstream distribution of the network.

Using hosts as an example, it supports visual queries of network traffic between hosts in the current workspace, allowing for quick analysis of TCP delays, TCP jitter, TCP retransmissions, TCP connection counts, and TCP closure counts between different hosts.

![](img/4.network_1.png)

- Time Widget: Defaults to fetching data from the last 48 hours and does not support automatic refresh; manual refresh is required.
- Search and Filtering: You can quickly search for host names based on fuzzy keyword matching or display host nodes and their associated relationships based on filtered tags.
- Filling: You can customize the filling of host nodes, with fill values determining the size and custom intervals of the node colors. Supports multiple fill metrics like TCP delay, TCP jitter, TCP retransmissions, TCP connection counts, and TCP closure counts.
- Host Nodes:
    - Host node icons are divided into regular hosts and cloud hosts, with cloud hosts displaying logos of cloud service providers.
    - Edge colors of host nodes are determined by the values of filled fields and custom intervals.
    - Host nodes are connected by lines representing network traffic, with bidirectional curves showing incoming/outgoing traffic from source to target hosts.
    - Node sizes are determined by the inbound traffic volume.
    - Line thicknesses are determined by the inbound and outbound traffic volumes.
- Custom Intervals: You can enable **Custom Intervals** to define color ranges for selected fill metrics. Legend colors are divided into five intervals based on maximum and minimum values, each corresponding to a different color. Lines and nodes outside the data range are grayed out.
- Mouse Hover: Hovering over a host node shows sent bytes, received bytes, TCP delay, TCP jitter, TCP retransmissions, TCP connection counts, and TCP closure counts.

**Note**: If the target host is not in the current workspace but the target domain exists and the port number is less than 10000, the target domain will be displayed in the service map.

### Correlation Analysis

Click on the host/Pod/Deployment/Services icon, then click **View Upstream/Downstream** to see the upstream/downstream nodes of the current node. You can also view host/Pod/Deployment/Services details, associated logs, traces, and events, and navigate accordingly.

![](img/4.network_9.png)

Click the **Return to Summary** button in the top-left corner to return to the original network map. Searching or filtering in the search box filters the associated upstream/downstream nodes according to the search or filter results.

![](img/4.network_10.png)

## Network Flow Data {#netflow}

As mentioned earlier, you can [view network flow data in the list detail page](#connect). Additionally, on the **Summary** or **Service Map** pages, click the **View Network Flow Data** button in the top-right corner to navigate to the corresponding page. You can view L4 (netflow) and L7 (httpflow) network flow data on the timeline. All network flow data auto-refreshes every 30 seconds, defaulting to the last 15 minutes of data.

Switch between **L4 Network Flow** and **L7 Network Flow** at the top to view different scheduled data.
