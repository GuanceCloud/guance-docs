# Infrastructure
---


Guance supports collecting data from hosts, containers, processes, networks, and other resource catalogs and reporting it to the workspace. On the **Infrastructure** page, you can view data for all objects through the list of infrastructure categories they belong to.

For example, to view metric data such as CPU and memory for host A, you can go to [**Hosts**](./host.md); to view CPU data for container B, you can go to **[Containers](./container.md)**.
