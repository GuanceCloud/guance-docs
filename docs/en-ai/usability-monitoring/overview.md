# Summary
---

In the **Summary** of Synthetic Tests, you can analyze the application performance of the target object under the current dial testing task from both geographical and trend dimensions, including response time, round-trip time, connection time, and availability.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Response Time | The time from when the request is sent by the client until the system responds. |
| Round-Trip Time | The time from when the client sends a data packet until it receives the returned data packet. |
| Connection Time | The time from when the client sends a request until the connection is established. |
| Availability | The success rate of client access requests. |
