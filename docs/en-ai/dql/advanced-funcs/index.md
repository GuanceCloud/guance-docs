# Advanced Functions


DQL queries support the selection of **advanced functions**. By using advanced functions, users can perform more in-depth analysis and processing of data according to their needs and expected outcomes.

Advanced functions are mainly used for further functional calculations on data retrieved by DQL and for intuitive time series chart displays. Guance provides official time series processing functions and also supports reporting custom data processing functions via local Func. In Guance's time series charts, you can select custom functions to reprocess the data and return the processed data for display.


The central functions are continuously updated by Guance's algorithm team. Currently, version v1 supports the use of DBSCAN advanced functions. Click to learn more:
