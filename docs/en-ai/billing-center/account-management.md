# Account Management
---

The Guance billing account is a dedicated account used to manage charges related to the use of Guance products. One billing account can be associated with multiple workspace billings. Account management includes changes to profile information, password modifications, real-name authentication, and cloud account management.

## Profile Changes

If there are personnel changes within an enterprise, the account profile in the Guance billing center needs to be updated. You can update the company name, industry, region, company description, contact person's name, email, and phone number under **Account Management > Profile**. Note that the email and phone number are the login credentials for the billing center, and verification is required when changing them.

### Change Email

## Cloud Account Management

A cloud account is the cloud account information saved after subscribing through a cloud provider. It can be used for settlement in new workspaces, meaning multiple workspaces can settle using the same cloud account. The Guance billing center supports Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts and Alibaba Cloud accounts. Under **Account Management > Cloud Accounts**, you can view subscribed cloud accounts and bind them to workspaces.

> For details on how to subscribe to cloud accounts, refer to the documentation: [Alibaba Cloud Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aliyun-account.md), [AWS Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aws-account.md), and [Huawei Cloud Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/huaweicloud-account.md);
