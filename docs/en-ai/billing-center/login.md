The Cost Center has two login methods: direct login via the Cost Center link and login to the Cost Center through Guance single sign-on.

## Guance Cost Center Login Method

You can directly log in to the Guance Cost Center via the link ([https://boss.guance.com/](https://boss.guance.com/)).

After logging into the Cost Center, you can check your account balance, recharge with cash, coupons, or prepaid cards, change settlement methods, manage accounts, view detailed bills, and perform other operations.

**Note**: If you forget your password, you can go to the [Guance Cost Center](https://boss.guance.com/) login page and use the **Forgot Password** option to retrieve it.
