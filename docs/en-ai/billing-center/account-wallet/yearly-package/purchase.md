## 5. Select Workspace

On the plan purchase page, choose the workspace(s) that will use the plan package. Multiple workspaces can be selected. If two workspaces are chosen, the traffic quota will first satisfy one workspace, and any remaining traffic will be applied to the other workspace. Any traffic exceeding the plan quota will be charged based on usage.

Example: Suppose you purchase a Startup Package for two workspaces, A and B, with a log data quota of 150 million entries. If both workspaces A and B use 100 million entries per day, the allocation would fully cover workspace A’s usage, leaving 50 million entries for workspace B, with the remaining 50 million entries charged based on usage. For detailed fee calculations, refer to the document [Plan Details](../../../../billing/cost-center/account-wallet/yearly-package/index.md).<br />![](../../../img/1.package_5.png)
