Guance offers multiple plans to help enterprises comprehensively monitor IT infrastructure, application systems, and other corporate assets at lower prices. Depending on the different stages of enterprise development, there are three plan packages: Startup Acceleration Package, Growth Development Package, and Enterprise Standard Package. Additionally, Guance also provides traffic packages for enterprises to use according to their own needs in conjunction with the selected plan.

## 5. Select Workspace

On the plan purchase page, choose the workspaces that will use the plan package. Multiple workspaces can be selected. If two workspaces are chosen, the traffic quota will first be applied to one workspace, with any remaining quota applied to the other workspace. Any usage exceeding the package quota will be charged based on actual usage.

Example: Suppose you purchase a Startup Package for two workspaces A and B, with a log data quota of 150 million entries. If both workspaces A and B each use 100 million log data entries per day, the deduction method would be as follows: Workspace A fully uses its quota, while Workspace B has 50 million entries deducted from the package, leaving the remaining 50 million entries to be charged based on actual usage. For detailed fee calculations, refer to the [Plan Description](../../../../billing/cost-center/account-wallet/yearly-package/index.md) documentation.<br />![](../../../img/1.package_5.png)
