The Guance billing account is a dedicated account used for managing charges related to the use of Guance products. A single billing account can be associated with multiple workspace billings. In the Guance billing center, you can perform cash top-ups, manage coupons, and manage prepaid cards.

**Note**:

- If you choose to settle using the Guance billing account, the deduction order for pay-as-you-go bills is as follows: regular coupons, discount coupons, prepaid cards, cash, and prepaid card balance (negative balance for overdue payments). For SMS and dial testing pay-as-you-go consumption, only cash and prepaid card or prepaid card balance can be used.
- If you choose to settle using cloud accounts, the deduction order for pay-as-you-go bills is as follows: regular coupons, discount coupons, prepaid cards, and cloud account cash balance. For SMS and dial testing pay-as-you-go consumption, only prepaid cards and cloud account cash balance can be used.

## Coupon Management

Coupons can be used for Guance pay-as-you-go charges and cloud account charges. They are divided into regular coupons and discount coupons. Regular coupons can be obtained through allocation, while discount coupons are automatically allocated when purchasing prepaid cards up to a certain level.

**Note**: Prepaid cards cannot be refunded once purchased. For more details, please visit the [Guance website's large customer discount plan](https://www.guance.com/billing#business#China) and contact a sales advisor for purchase.

In the Guance billing center, click **Manage Coupons > Activate Coupon**, enter the activation code, and confirm submission.

## Prepaid Card Management

Guance prepaid cards can be purchased using account cash balance or allocated by partners, applicable to all Guance consumption models, including pay-as-you-go and cloud account charges.

**Note**: If the account cash balance is insufficient, it will continue to deduct from the prepaid card balance (negative balance for overdue payments). Recharging cash to buy prepaid cards will prioritize offsetting overdue balances.

### Purchase Prepaid Cards

Log in to the Guance [billing center](https://boss.guance.com), click **Manage Prepaid Cards**, and you will enter the prepaid card management and purchase page.
