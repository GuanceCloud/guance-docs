The Guance Billing Center is the fee settlement management platform for the Commercial Plan of Guance, featuring an independent account system. By binding Guance workspaces, it retrieves billing information from these workspaces to achieve unified cost management at the workspace level.

<font size=3>**Note**: The Guance Billing Center supports the following browsers: **Chrome, Safari, Edge, IE11, IE10, IE9, WeChat, DingTalk**.</font>

> The Commercial Plan of Guance adopts a **pay-as-you-go** billing method. For more billing details, refer to [Usage-based Billing](../billing-method/index.md).

Guance provides various settlement methods through the Billing Center accounts and cloud accounts, including Alibaba Cloud, AWS, and Huawei Cloud account settlements. Under the cloud account settlement model, multiple site cloud bills can be consolidated into one cloud account for settlement.
