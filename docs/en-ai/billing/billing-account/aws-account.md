**Note**: After cancelling the subscription to the Guance service on Amazon Cloud, all associated workspaces bound to this account in the Guance Billing Center will have their cloud account association deleted and all associated workspaces will undergo a [lock](../../billing-center/workspace-management.md#workspace-lock) operation. You can unlock the workspaces in **Billing Center > Workspace Management**.
