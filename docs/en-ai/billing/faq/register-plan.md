## How can AWS users activate Guance?

AWS users can choose the "China Region 2 (Ningxia)" or "Overseas Region 1 (Oregon)" sites to [register for Guance](../../plans/commercial-register.md). After registration, you can [settle accounts using your AWS China region account](../billing-account/aws-account.md).

## What are the differences between the Commercial Plan and Exclusive Plan of Guance? Can they be switched?

They cannot be switched. The Commercial Plan uses the default ES storage method, while the Exclusive Plan uses the SLS storage method.

> For more details, refer to [Data Storage Methods](../../billing-method/data-storage.md#options).

**Note**: Only by purchasing the Exclusive Plan from the Alibaba Cloud marketplace can you activate SLS storage. Workspaces that have activated the default storage method do not support switching to SLS storage.

> For more details, refer to [Purchasing an Exclusive Plan Product from the Alibaba Cloud Marketplace](../../plans/commercial-aliyun-sls.md).

## Why might a workspace be locked?

If you choose to settle accounts using an Alibaba Cloud account, once it is released, expired, or deleted, the associated workspace will be automatically locked. Guance will send relevant email notifications; this applies similarly to AWS and Huawei Cloud accounts.

## How can a locked workspace be restored?

After a workspace is locked, please contact your customer manager. All subsequent unlock operations will be handled by the Guance side.

## If the above common issues cannot be resolved, how can I get online support?

Guance provides online ticket [support](../../billing-center/support-center.md).
