## What is the difference between Guance Billing Center account settlement and cloud account settlement?

- [Guance Billing Center account settlement](../../billing/billing-account/enterprise-account.md): Directly recharge and settle in the Guance Billing Center. You can recharge the Guance Billing Center account through cash, purchasing coupons, or prepaid cards;
- [Cloud account settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aliyun-account.md): Directly recharge and settle using the corresponding cloud provider's account.

## What is flexible account settlement?

Flexible account settlement means that when you **change the settlement method** in the Guance Billing Center, you can choose any cloud account for settlement without being restricted by the registration site. For example, if you registered an account at "China Region 1 (Hangzhou)" site, which defaults to **Alibaba Cloud account settlement**, but if you enable flexible account settlement, you can choose "Amazon Web Services account settlement."

To enable this feature, please contact your account manager.
