# Invite Members

In the current workspace, Owners, Administrators, and custom roles authorized with **Member Management** permissions can invite registered users of Guance to become new members of the workspace.

## Invitation Entry Points

You can invite members through the following two entry points:

### :material-numeric-1-circle: Member Management Page

![](img/8.member_1.png)

Go to **Management > Member Management > Invite Members**. In the current window, enter the email address of the invited member and press Enter, then click **Confirm** to send an invitation notification for the current workspace. After the member completes authentication, they can enter the workspace.

- Supports inviting multiple members at once.
- Supports selecting one or more roles to set permissions for new members. You can also create custom roles for members via [Role Management](role-management.md).

### :material-numeric-2-circle: Navigation Bar Shortcut {#navigation}

1. In the left navigation bar of the current workspace, click **Invite Members**:

**Note**: By default, only **Read-only Members** do not have this permission; other roles have this permission configured.

After sending the invitation notification, if the **Settings > Invitation Approval** button is not enabled in the workspace, the invited member can directly enter the workspace.

If it is enabled, you need to go to **Management > Invitation Records** for processing. <u>By default, the member will not be added to any workspace and requires approval from the workspace owner or administrator to join</u>.

## Invitation Records

On the current page, you can view all member invitation actions within the current workspace, including their emails, assigned roles, inviter, invitation time, approval status, etc.

On the invitation records page, the following operations are supported:

:material-numeric-1-circle-outline: In the top status bar, filter by different statuses to quickly narrow down the range.

The meanings of different status values are as follows:

| Status Value | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Pending Response | The invitation has been sent, but the invited member has not yet applied to join the current workspace via the invitation link. |
| Pending Approval | The invited member has applied to join a workspace and is awaiting approval; <br />:warning: Only in this state can approval actions be performed. |
| Approved | Approved, which is the status after approval. |
| Rejected | Not approved, which is the status after rejection. |
| Expired | Currently, the validity period of Guance's invitation links is 1 day. If the invited member does not apply to join before the link expires, the invitation record will show this status. |

**Note**: If the assigned role no longer exists when the approval is passed, the member will be assigned the **Read-only Member** role by default.

:material-numeric-2-circle-outline: In the üîç search bar, you can search by nickname, name, or email.

:material-numeric-3-circle-outline: In the action column, if a member invitation is in the **Pending Approval** state, you can choose to approve or reject it.

:material-numeric-4-circle-outline: Batch Operations: Click the :material-square-outline: next to the email. If a member invitation is in the **Pending Approval** state, you can batch select to approve or reject.
