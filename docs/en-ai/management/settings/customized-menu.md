# Feature Menu Management
---

Guance supports manual configuration of feature menus, including hiding/displaying and adjusting the menu order, to help customize the menu display for the current workspace.

**Note**: Feature menu management is configurable by users with administrator-level roles or higher. After configuration, subsequent workspace members will see the configured menu upon login.

## Configure Custom Menus

**Note**: The menu configuration here will be affected by the [menu settings](../../deployment/menu.md) in the management backend, but it will not affect the menu configuration in the management backend.

In the Guance workspace **Management > Settings > Advanced Settings > Feature Menu Management**, click **Configure** to adjust the menu.

In addition to the default selected states for Scenarios, Events, Monitoring, and Integrations, you can perform the following actions:

1. Check to display the feature menus for the current workspace;
2. Adjust the menu order using the small icons on the right;
3. Click **Reset** to revert to the [menu settings](../../deployment/menu.md) unified in the management backend.
