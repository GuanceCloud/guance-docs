# Data Forwarding to AWS S3
---

## Getting Started with Configuration

1. Select **AWS S3** as the archive type, which means that matched log data will be saved to this object storage.
2. Choose the [access type](#type).
3. Click confirm to create successfully.

**Note**: If the archive type information changes, ensure that the associated platform configuration is updated synchronously to avoid data write failures due to configuration changes. New configuration rules will take effect within 5 minutes.

## Access Type {#type}

### Role Authorization

<img src="../../img/back-2.png" width="70%" >

1. You must use the external ID generated by Guance to configure third-party access rights for AWS resources.
2. After [configuring the IAM role for Guance in AWS](../role-auth.md), fill in the archive information, including the AWS account ID, AWS role name, region, and bucket name.
3. Enter the [storage path](#standard) to facilitate further differentiation and location of the specific data forwarding path.
4. Click **Test Connection**; if the provided information meets the specifications, a successful connection test message will be displayed. Click confirm to save the current rule.

#### Directory Path (Folder) Naming Conventions {#standard}

1. Create a single folder or multiple levels of folders, where a slash (/) indicates the creation of multi-level folders.
2. Folder names cannot start or end with a slash (/).
3. They cannot contain more than two consecutive slashes (/).
4. Applies to all access types.

**Note**:

- If the entered folder does not exist, Guance will create it directly, and data will still be stored under this path.
- Be cautious when changing the storage path, as there is about a 5-minute delay in updating configurations. Some data may still be forwarded to the original directory after changes.

???+ warning "If the test fails:"

    You need to confirm:

    - Whether the external ID has expired;
    - Whether the account ID is correct;
    - Whether the account role exists;
    - Whether the bucket exists;
    - Whether the Region is inconsistent.

    **When encountering the following situations, proceed with caution:**

    - If you click to regenerate the external ID, the historical ID will expire after 24 hours. Please replace it on the AWS console as soon as possible.
    - Do not repeatedly click to generate an external ID; proceed with caution!

### Access Keys
