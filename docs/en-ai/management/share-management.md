# Share Management
---

Guance supports unified management of shared charts and snapshots within the current space through **Management > Share Management**.


## Sharing Charts

Guance allows space administrators and standard members to share and manage charts. Chart sharing can be used to embed charts in external platform code for visual data presentation and analysis.

> For more details, refer to [Chart Sharing](../scene/visual-chart/index.md#share).

After completing chart sharing in the **Scene View**, you can view the list of shared charts in the current space via **Management > Share Management > Shared Charts** and perform <u>batch operations, chart viewing, viewing embed codes, and canceling shares</u>.
