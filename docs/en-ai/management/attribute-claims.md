# Attribute Claims

<!--
Typically, an enterprise creates multiple workspaces to manage different businesses. Therefore, when invoking different services, the services monitored by the enterprise may be scattered across various spaces. Attribute claims help you see the invocation relationships of all services from a global perspective, and using attribute fields can enable correlated queries.
-->

In **Management > Attribute Claims**, you can view JSON-formatted attribute information. Guance predefines two fixed attribute fields: `organization` and `business`.

- `organization`: Automatically generated by the system; it is the organization ID, which is a unique ID generated based on the service charges account associated with the current workspace. All Commercial Plan workspaces belong to an organization. If multiple workspaces are bound to the same service charges account, they will have the same ID.

    - **Note**: For Deployment Plan users, the `organization` has a unified fixed ID.

- `business`: Cannot be deleted; it has business attributes, and you can filter and view it within the workspace list.

Click the edit button on the right to enter the attribute claims editing page:

As shown in the figure, `organization` cannot be edited or deleted; you can edit `business`.

Click **Add Attribute** to define custom attributes. Both the attribute name (`key`) and attribute value (`value`) are required fields.

## Applicable Scenarios

When you configure custom fields in attribute claims, these fields will also be synchronized in scenarios where events are sent externally for notification.
