# Environment Variables

Environment variables are a convenient configuration method that allow you to remotely adjust DataKit's data collection settings on the platform. Depending on different application environments, you can flexibly modify DataKit's behavior. DataKit will automatically synchronize the latest environment variables and optimize its data collection strategy accordingly, simplifying the configuration process.
