## Window Operations

1. Enter this page to view all workspaces associated with your account;
2. On the workspace card, it directly displays your role permissions in that workspace and the number of members in the workspace;
3. Filter by version, role, and business;
4. In the search bar, input the workspace name or description to quickly search and locate.


## Card Operations

Hover over a workspace card to perform the following operations:

1. Click :octicons-clock-16: to view the creation time of the workspace;
2. Click :material-dots-vertical: to set notes for the current workspace; pin the space or set it as the default space (the workspace you enter by default after logging in, applied only to the current login account); you can also exit or dissolve the current workspace.


**Note**:

1. Only the workspace owner can dissolve the current workspace. Once dissolved, data cannot be recovered. Please operate with caution.
2. After dissolution, the workspace will automatically be unlinked from the billing center and deleted.
