# Global Labels

Global labels refer to tags that can be directly invoked within the Guance workspace. Through global labels, you can categorize, filter, and screen data that meets requirements, ultimately achieving global data integration.

**Note**: Only Owner, Administrator, and custom roles can view this feature.

2. Description: Optional; up to 100 characters;
3. Color: The first color block is the default color, but you can customize your selection;
4. Continue creating the next one: You can continue creating labels without closing the pop-up window after clicking OK.
