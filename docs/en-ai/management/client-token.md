# Client Token Management

Client Token in <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s RUM application is a key used to securely send data from user devices to the server. When users interact with a website or application, the Client Token is sent along with performance data so that the server can verify and receive this data, ensuring the security and accuracy of the data. This token mechanism not only simplifies the authentication process but also supports efficient cross-domain data transmission, providing <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> with a simple and effective way to collect and analyze users' actual usage.

Client Tokens primarily appear in scenarios where applications are integrated into RUM. When using a public DataWay to integrate with the RUM application, <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> will automatically generate a Client Token for you. This token is used to send data from user devices. You can use this default Token or click to switch to a [newly created](#create) Token.

## Create Token {#create}

1. Enter the Client Token name;
2. Click Confirm;
3. Copy the Client Token automatically generated by <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> as needed.

## Manage Token List

All created Client Tokens are listed in the list. You can directly view the Client Token name, Client Token, creator, and creation time through the list.

Click the delete button to delete the current Token. After deletion, if any agents are using this token, data reporting will immediately stop.

**Note**: If the application is deleted, the corresponding Client Token in the Client Token management list will also be deleted synchronously.
