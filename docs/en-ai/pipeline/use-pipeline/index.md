# Pipeline Manual

## Introduction

Since DataKit v1.4.0, the built-in Pipeline data processor function can be used to modify, extract, filter, aggregate, and perform other operations on data collected or received by DataKit. It supports all current data categories (such as Logging, Metric, Tracing, Network, and Object, etc.).

The DataKit Pipeline programmable data processor supports the runtime provided by Platypus, a domain-specific language developed by Guance. More programming languages and runtimes will be added to Pipeline in the future.
