# List Management

For all dashboards within the current workspace, you can manage them through the following operations.

## Batch Operations

This involves selecting dashboards for batch deletion, export, or modification of visibility scope.

**Note**:

1. The homepage dashboard does not support modifying the visibility scope.
2. Dashboards not created by the user do not support changing the scope to "Visible only to me" here.

## Modify/Export/Delete {#options}

Click the :material-dots-vertical: button on the dashboard to modify the dashboard name, export the dashboard to a JSON file, and delete the dashboard.

## Set Homepage Dashboard

Set a dashboard as the workspace-level **Homepage Dashboard**. After setting, when members access this space, the homepage dashboard will be displayed by default.

**Note**: Only dashboards with "Public" visibility can be set as the **Homepage Dashboard**, and once set, the visibility scope cannot be modified.

## Filtering/Sorting

On the left side of the dashboard, you can quickly filter and find corresponding dashboards through different categories.

You can also set tags for dashboards to quickly filter them.
