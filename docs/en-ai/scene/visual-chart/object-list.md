| Lock Time | Fix the time range for querying data in the current chart, independent of the global time component. After successful setup, the user-defined time will appear in the top-right corner of the chart, such as 【xx minutes】, 【xx hours】, 【xx days】. For example, if the locked time interval is 30 minutes, the chart will only display data from the last 30 minutes regardless of the time range selected in the time component. |
