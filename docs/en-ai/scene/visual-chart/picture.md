### Display Options

Types:

- Fill: The image is proportionally resized and then scaled based on the shortest side of the image to fit the card's largest side, achieving a screen-filling effect;
- Fit: The image is proportionally resized, but it stops scaling when its longest side matches the card's shortest side, maximizing the image while maintaining its aspect ratio;
- Stretch: The image is not proportionally resized but stretched according to the card size;
- Center: The image remains unchanged in size and is centered.
