### Display Options

Types:

- Fill: The image is proportionally resized and then scaled according to the smallest side of the image to match the largest side of the card, achieving a screen-filling effect;
- Fit: The image is proportionally resized, but it stops scaling when the largest side of the image matches the smallest side of the card, maximizing the image while maintaining its aspect ratio;
- Stretch: The image is not proportionally resized but stretched according to the card size;
- Center: The image remains at its original size and is centered.
