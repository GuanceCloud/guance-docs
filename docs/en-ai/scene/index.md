In the Scene feature, Guance primarily uses charts to allow you to intuitively reproduce data insights through a series of custom editing and filtering functions.

At the same time, Guance [provides multiple built-in data monitoring view templates](./built-in-view/index.md) that you can import to create dashboards and Explorers, and perform custom editing configurations; or choose a custom creation method to build data insight scenes with relevant settings.
