## Configuration {#config}

### Prerequisites

You need administrative permissions for both the "Guance Workspace" and the "Feishu Open Platform".

### Install Func

We recommend enabling the Guance integration - extension - DataFlux Func (Automata): all prerequisites are automatically installed. Please proceed with the script installation.

If you choose to deploy Func on your own, refer to [Self-deployed Func](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-integration/){:target="_blank"}

> We recommend deploying the GSE version.

### Install Script

In the script market, install the corresponding collection script: “Guance Integration (Guance Incident-Feishu)” (ID: `guance_issue_feishu`) to enable it.

For easier documentation maintenance, please go to [Feishu Integration Configuration](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-issue-feishu-integration/){:target="_blank"} for operation.
