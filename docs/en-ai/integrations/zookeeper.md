## Installation and Deployment {#config}

Note: The example ZooKeeper version is 3.6.3 (CentOS). Versions 3.6+ have many more metrics than previous versions. If you are using a version prior to 3.6, some metrics may not be collected.

### Enable Zookeeper Metrics

- Enable the Metrics Providers configuration in Zookeeper (default configuration file location: Zookeeper installation directory `/conf/zoo.cfg`) and add `4lw.commands.whitelist=*`

```shell
> ## Metrics Providers
> #
> # [https://prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io) Metrics Exporter
> metricsProvider.className=org.apache.zookeeper.metrics.prometheus.PrometheusMetricsProvider
> metricsProvider.httpPort=7000
> metricsProvider.exportJvmInfo=true
> 4lw.commands.whitelist=*
```

- Restart the ZooKeeper cluster to apply the configuration.
- Download and install [zookeeper_exporter](https://github.com/carlpett/zookeeper_exporter/releases/download/v1.1.0/zookeeper_exporter), assign execution permissions with `chmod +x`, and start it. The default port is 9141, and you can verify the data using the command:

```bash
[root@d ~]# curl 0.0.0.0:9141/metrics
zk_sync_process_time{quantile="0_5",zk_host="172.16.0.196:2181"} NaN

zk_connection_token_deficit_count{zk_host="172.16.0.23:2181"} 2.0
......
```

### Enable DataKit Collector

- Enable the DataKit Prom plugin and copy the sample file

```bash
/usr/local/datakit/conf.d/prom
cp prom.conf.sample prom.conf
```

- Modify the `prom.conf` configuration file

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

??? quote "Configuration as follows"

    ```toml
    [[inputs.prom]]
    ## Exporter URLs
    urls = ["[http://127.0.0.1:9141/metrics"]](http://127.0.0.1:9141/metrics"])

    ## Ignore request errors for URLs
    ignore_req_err = false

    ## Collector alias
    source = "zookeeper"

    ## Output source for collected data
    # Configure this to write collected data to a local file instead of sending it to the center
    # You can then use the `datakit --prom-conf /path/to/this/conf` command to debug locally saved Mearsurement
    # If the URL is configured as a local file path, the `--prom-conf` option takes precedence when debugging output path data
    # output = "/abs/path/to/file"
    > 
    ## Maximum size of collected data, in bytes
    # Set a maximum size limit for collected data when writing it to a local file
    # If the size of the collected data exceeds this limit, the data will be discarded
    # The default maximum size limit is set to 32MB
    # max_file_size = 0

    ## Metric type filter, options are counter, gauge, histogram, summary
    # By default, only counter and gauge types of metrics are collected
    # If empty, no filtering is performed
    metric_types = ["counter", "gauge"]

    ## Metric name filter
    # Supports regular expressions; multiple configurations can be set, where satisfying any one condition suffices
    # If empty, no filtering is performed
    # metric_name_filter = ["cpu"]

    ## Prefix for Mearsurement names
    # Configuring this adds a prefix to the Mearsurement names
    measurement_prefix = ""

    ## Mearsurement name
    # By default, the metric name is split by underscores ("_"), with the first field becoming the Mearsurement name and the remaining fields becoming the current metric name
    # If `measurement_name` is configured, the metric name splitting does not occur
    # The final Mearsurement name will include the `measurement_prefix` prefix
    # measurement_name = "prom"

    ## Collection interval "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"
    interval = "10s"

    ## Filter tags, multiple tags can be configured
    # Matching tags will be ignored
    # tags_ignore = ["xxxx"]

    ## TLS Configuration
    tls_open = false
    # tls_ca = "/tmp/ca.crt"
    # tls_cert = "/tmp/peer.crt"
    # tls_key = "/tmp/peer.key"

    ## Custom authentication method, currently only supports Bearer Token
    # Only one of `token` or `token_file` needs to be configured
    # [inputs.prom.auth]
    # type = "bearer_token"
    # token = "xxxxxxxx"
    # token_file = "/tmp/token"

    ## Custom Mearsurement names
    # Metrics containing the prefix `prefix` can be grouped into one Mearsurement
    # Custom Mearsurement name configuration takes precedence over `measurement_name`
    #[[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    #  prefix = "cpu_"
    #  name = "cpu"

    # [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    # prefix = "mem_"
    # name = "mem"

    ## Custom Tags
    [inputs.prom.tags]
      service = "zookeeper"
    # more_tag = "some_other_value"
    ```
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->
- Restart DataKit (if you need to enable logging, configure log collection before restarting)

```bash
systemctl restart datakit
```

- Verify with DQL

```bash
[root@df-solution-ecs-018 prom]# datakit -Q

Flag -Q deprecated, please use datakit help to use recommend flags.
