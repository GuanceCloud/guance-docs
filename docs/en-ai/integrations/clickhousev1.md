The ClickHouse collector can gather various metrics exposed by the ClickHouse server instance, such as statement execution counts and memory storage, IO interactions, and many other metrics. It then sends these metrics to Guance for monitoring and analyzing any anomalies in ClickHouse.

## Configuration {#config}

### Prerequisites {#requirements}

- ClickHouse version >=v20.1.2.4
- In the `config.xml` configuration file of the ClickHouse Server, find the following code segment, uncomment it, and set the port number for exposing metrics (choose a unique one). After modification, restart the service (if it is a cluster, each machine must be operated).

```shell
vim /etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml
```

```xml
<prometheus>
    <endpoint>/metrics</endpoint>
    <port>9363</port>
    <metrics>true</metrics>
    <events>true</events>
    <asynchronous_metrics>true</asynchronous_metrics>
</prometheus>
```

Field descriptions:

- `endpoint`: HTTP route for Prometheus server to scrape metrics.
- `port`: Port number of the endpoint.
- `metrics`: Flag to enable scraping exposed metrics from ClickHouse's `system.metrics` table.
- `events`: Flag to enable scraping exposed events from ClickHouse's `system.events` table.
- `asynchronous_metrics`: Flag to enable scraping exposed asynchronous metrics from ClickHouse's `system.asynchronous_metrics` table.

### Collector Configuration {input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Host Installation"

    Enter the `conf.d/clickhousev1` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `clickhousev1.conf.sample`, and rename it to `clickhousev1.conf`. Example configuration:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.clickhousev1]]
      ## Exporter URLs.
      urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:9363/metrics"]
    
      ## Unix Domain Socket URL. Using socket to request data when not empty.
      uds_path = ""
    
      ## Ignore URL request errors.
      ignore_req_err = false
    
      ## Collect data output.
      ## Fill this when wanting to collect data to a local file or center.
      ## After filling, use 'datakit debug --prom-conf /path/to/this/conf' to debug local storage measurement set.
      ## Use '--prom-conf' when prioritizing debugging data in 'output' path.
      # output = "/abs/path/to/file"
    
      ## Collect data upper limit as bytes.
      ## Only available when setting output to a local file.
      ## If collected data exceeds the limit, the data will be dropped.
      ## Default is 32MB.
      # max_file_size = 0
    
      ## Metrics type whitelist. Optional: counter, gauge, histogram, summary
      ## Example: metric_types = ["counter", "gauge"], only collect 'counter' and 'gauge'.
      ## Default collect all.
      # metric_types = []
    
      ## Metrics name whitelist.
      ## Regex supported. Multi-supported, conditions met when one matched.
      ## Collect all if empty.
      # metric_name_filter = ["cpu"]
    
      ## Metrics name blacklist.
      ## If a word is both in the blacklist and whitelist, blacklist takes precedence.
      ## Regex supported. Multi-supported, conditions met when one matched.
      ## Collect all if empty.
      # metric_name_filter_ignore = ["foo","bar"]
    
      ## Measurement prefix.
      ## Add prefix to measurement set name.
      measurement_prefix = ""
    
      ## Measurement name.
      ## If measurement_name is empty, split metric name by '_', the first field after split as measurement set name, the rest as current metric name.
      ## If measurement_name is not empty, use this as measurement set name.
      ## Always add 'measurement_prefix' prefix at last.
      # measurement_name = "clickhouse"
    
      ## TLS configuration.
      tls_open = false
      # tls_ca = "/tmp/ca.crt"
      # tls_cert = "/tmp/peer.crt"
      # tls_key = "/tmp/peer.key"
    
      ## Set to 'true' to enable election.
      election = true
    
      ## Disable setting host tag for this input

      ## Disable setting instance tag for this input
      disable_instance_tag = false
    
      ## Disable info tag for this input
      disable_info_tag = false
    
      ## Ignore tags. Multi-supported.
      ## The matched tags will be dropped, but the item will still be sent.
      # tags_ignore = ["xxxx"]
    
      ## Customize authentication. Currently supports Bearer Token only.
      ## Filling in 'token' or 'token_file' is acceptable.
      # [inputs.clickhousev1.auth]
        # type = "bearer_token"
        # token = "xxxxxxxx"
        # token_file = "/tmp/token"
    
      ## Customize measurement set name.
      ## Treat those metrics with prefix as one set.
      ## Prioritize over 'measurement_name' configuration.
      [[inputs.clickhousev1.measurements]]
        prefix = "ClickHouseProfileEvents_"
        name = "ClickHouseProfileEvents"
    
      [[inputs.clickhousev1.measurements]]
        prefix = "ClickHouseMetrics_"
        name = "ClickHouseMetrics"
    
      [[inputs.clickhousev1.measurements]]
        prefix = "ClickHouseAsyncMetrics_"
        name = "ClickHouseAsyncMetrics"
    
      [[inputs.clickhousev1.measurements]]
        prefix = "ClickHouseStatusInfo_"
        name = "ClickHouseStatusInfo"
    
      ## Do not collect data when tag matches.
      [inputs.clickhousev1.ignore_tag_kv_match]
        # key1 = [ "val1.*", "val2.*"]
        # key2 = [ "val1.*", "val2.*"]
    
      ## Add HTTP headers to data pulling.
      [inputs.clickhousev1.http_headers]
        # Root = "passwd"
        # Michael = "1234"
    
      ## Rename tag keys in ClickHouse data.
      [inputs.clickhousev1.tags_rename]
        overwrite_exist_tags = false
      [inputs.clickhousev1.tags_rename.mapping]
        # tag1 = "new-name-1"
        # tag2 = "new-name-2"
        # tag3 = "new-name-3"
    
      ## Customize tags.
      [inputs.clickhousev1.tags]
        # some_tag = "some_value"
        # more_tag = "some_other_value"
      
      ## (Optional) Collection interval: (defaults to "30s").
      # interval = "30s"
    
      ## (Optional) Timeout: (defaults to "30s").
      # timeout = "30s"
      
    ```

    After configuring, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    Currently, you can enable the collector by injecting the collector configuration via [ConfigMap method](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

## Metrics {#metric}

By default, all collected data will append global election tags, and additional tags can be specified in the configuration through `[inputs.clickhousev1.tags]`:

``` toml
[inputs.prom.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
```

|`OSMemoryBuffers`|The amount of memory used by OS kernel buffers, in bytes. This should be typically small, and large values may indicate a misconfiguration of the OS. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`.|float|B|
|`OSMemoryCached`|The amount of memory used by the OS page cache, in bytes. Typically, almost all available memory is used by the OS page cache - high values of this metric are normal and expected. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`.|float|B|
|`OSMemoryFreePlusCached`|The amount of free memory plus OS page cache memory on the host system, in bytes. This memory is available to be used by programs. The value should be very similar to `OSMemoryAvailable`. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`.|float|B|
|`OSMemoryFreeWithoutCached`|The amount of free memory on the host system, in bytes. This does not include the memory used by the OS page cache memory, in bytes. The page cache memory is also available for usage by programs, so the value of this metric can be confusing. See the `OSMemoryAvailable` metric instead. For convenience we also provide the `OSMemoryFreePlusCached` metric, that should be somewhat similar to OSMemoryAvailable. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`.|float|B|
|`OSMemorySwapCached`|The amount of memory in swap that was also loaded in RAM. Swap should be disabled on production systems. If the value of this metric is large, it indicates a misconfiguration.  This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`.|float|B|
|`OSMemoryTotal`|The total amount of memory on the host system, in bytes.|float|B|
|`OSNiceTime`|The ratio of time the CPU core was running `userspace` code with higher priority. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`. The value for a single CPU core will be in the interval [0..1]. The value for all CPU cores is calculated as a sum across them [0..num cores].|float|rate|
|`OSNiceTimeCPU`|The ratio of time the CPU core was running `userspace` code with higher priority. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`. The value for a single CPU core will be in the interval [0..1]. The value for all CPU cores is calculated as a sum across them [0..num cores].|float|rate|
|`OSNiceTimeNormalized`|The value is similar to `OSNiceTime` but divided to the number of CPU cores to be measured in the [0..1] interval regardless of the number of cores. This allows you to average the values of this metric across multiple servers in a cluster even if the number of cores is non-uniform, and still get the average resource utilization metric.|float|rate|
|`OSOpenFiles`|The total number of opened files on the host machine. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`.|float|count|
|`OSProcessesBlocked`|Number of threads blocked waiting for I/O to complete (`man procfs`). This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`.|float|count|
|`OSProcessesCreated`|The number of processes created. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`.|float|count|
|`OSProcessesRunning`|The number of runnable (running or ready to run) threads by the operating system. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`.|float|count|
|`OSSoftIrqTime`|The ratio of time spent for running software interrupt requests on the CPU. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`. A high number of this metric may indicate inefficient software running on the system. The value for a single CPU core will be in the interval [0..1]. The value for all CPU cores is calculated as a sum across them [0..num cores].|float|rate|
|`OSSoftIrqTimeCPU`|The ratio of time spent for running software interrupt requests on the CPU. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`. A high number of this metric may indicate inefficient software running on the system. The value for a single CPU core will be in the interval [0..1]. The value for all CPU cores is calculated as a sum across them [0..num cores].|float|rate|
|`OSSoftIrqTimeNormalized`|The value is similar to `OSSoftIrqTime` but divided to the number of CPU cores to be measured in the [0..1] interval regardless of the number of cores. This allows you to average the values of this metric across multiple servers in a cluster even if the number of cores is non-uniform, and still get the average resource utilization metric.|float|rate|
|`OSStealTime`|The ratio of time spent in other operating systems by the CPU when running in a virtualized environment. This is a system-wide metric, it includes all the processes on the host machine, not just `clickhouse-server`. Not every virtualized environments present this metric, and most of them don't. The value for a single CPU core will be in the interval [0..1]. The value for all CPU cores is calculated as a sum across them [0..num cores].|float|rate|
|`OSStealTimeCPU`|The ratio of time spent in other operating systems by the CPU when running in a virtualized environment. This is
