MinIO V3 performance Metrics display, including MinIO uptime, storage space distribution, bucket details, file size range distribution, S3 TTFB (s) distribution, S3 traffic, S3 requests, etc.

## Configuration {#config}

### Version Support

- MinIO Version: v3

### MinIO Metrics Exposure

MinIO officially provides Prometheus-style Metrics for collection by observability tools such as Prometheus for analysis and alerting. MinIO's Metrics endpoints include API metrics, Audit metrics, Cluster metrics, Debug metrics, among others, which can be obtained separately from each endpoint; see the documentation for more details. The latest MinIO Metrics version 3 allows all Metrics to be retrieved from a single endpoint (/minio/metrics/v3), significantly simplifying the collection process.

By default, when an observability tool fetches MinIO Metrics, it needs to generate a bearer token using the `mc` command first; refer to [MinIO v2](./minio.md).

For passwordless fetching, you can set the metric exposure method to `Public` via the `MINIO_PROMETHEUS_AUTH_TYPE` environment variable in MinIO, specifically:

Edit the `/etc/default/minio` file and add `MINIO_PROMETHEUS_AUTH_TYPE="public"` to enable public access for Metric collection.

### Enable DataKit Collector

```shell
cd /usr/local/datakit/conf.d/prom/
cp prom.conf.sample prom-minio.conf
```

Modify the `prom-minio.conf` configuration file:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

```toml
[[inputs.prom]]
    # Exporter URLs
    urls = ["http://minio-endpoint:9000/minio/metrics/v3"]

    # Collector alias
    source = "minio"
    metric_types = []

    # Custom Tags
    [inputs.prom.tags]
    version="v3"
    ...
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->
Adjust the parameters above. Parameter descriptions:

- urls: The Prometheus Metrics URL, fill in the exposed MinIO Metrics URL here.
- source: Collector alias, recommended to use `minio`.
- [inputs.prom.tags]: Tag information

- Restart DataKit
