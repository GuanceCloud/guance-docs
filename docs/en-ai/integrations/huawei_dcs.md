Collecting Huawei Cloud DCS Metrics Data

## Configuration {#config}

### Installing Func

It is recommended to activate the Guance Integration - Extension - Managed Func: All prerequisites are automatically installed. Please proceed with the script installation.

If you deploy Func on your own, refer to [Self-deployed Func](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-integration/){:target="_blank"}

### Installing Scripts

> Note: Prepare a qualified Huawei Cloud AK in advance (for simplicity, you can directly grant read-only access `ReadOnlyAccess`)

To synchronize monitoring data from Huawei Cloud DCS, we install the corresponding collection scripts:

- **guance_huaweicloud_dcs**: Collects Huawei Cloud DCS Metrics Data
- **guance_huaweicloud_dcs_slowlog**: Collects Huawei Cloud DCS Slow Log Data

After clicking 【Install】, enter the corresponding parameters: Huawei Cloud AK and Huawei Cloud account name.

Click 【Deploy Startup Script】and the system will automatically create a `Startup` script set and configure the startup scripts accordingly.

Once the script installation is complete, find the script "Guance Integration (Huawei Cloud-DCS Collection)" / "Guance Integration (Huawei Cloud-DCS Slow Query Log Collection)" under "Development" in Func, expand it, and modify the script by editing the content of `region_projects`. Change the region and Project ID to the actual ones, then click Save and Publish.

Additionally, view the corresponding auto-trigger configurations under "Management / Auto Trigger Configurations". Click 【Execute】to run it immediately without waiting for the scheduled time. After a short while, you can check the task execution records and corresponding logs.

### Verification

1. Confirm the corresponding tasks exist under "Management / Auto Trigger Configurations", and check the task records and logs for any anomalies.
2. On the Guance platform, under "Infrastructure / Custom", verify if asset information exists.
3. On the Guance platform, under "Metrics", check if there is corresponding monitoring data.
4. On the Guance platform, under "Logs", check if there is corresponding log data.

## Metrics {#metric}
