The External collector can launch external programs for data collection.

## Configuration {#config}

### Prerequisites {#requirements}

- Ensure that the program to be launched and its runtime environment dependencies are complete. For example, if using Python to launch an external Python script, the required packages and dependencies for running the script must be available.

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

=== "Host Installation"

    Navigate to the `conf.d/external` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `external.conf.sample`, and rename it to `external.conf`. An example is shown below:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.external]]
    
        # Collector's name.
        name = 'some-external-inputs'  # required
    
        # Whether or not to run the external program in the background.
        daemon = false
    
        # If the external program runs in Non-daemon mode,
        #     it will be executed at this interval.
        #interval = '10s'
    
        # Environment variables for running the external program.
        #envs = ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH',]
    
        # Full path of the external program. Use absolute paths whenever possible.
        cmd = "python" # required
    
        # Set "true" if this collector is involved in the election.
        # Note: The external program must run in daemon mode if it participates in the election.
        election = false
        args = []
    
        [[inputs.external.tags]]
            # tag1 = "val1"
            # tag2 = "val2"
    
    ```
    
    After configuration, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    Currently, you can enable the collector by [injecting the collector configuration via ConfigMap](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).
