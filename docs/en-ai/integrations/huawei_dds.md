Collect Huawei Cloud DDS Metrics data

## Configuration {#config}

### Install Func

It is recommended to enable Guance integration - Extension - DataFlux Func (Automata): all prerequisites are automatically installed. Please proceed with the script installation.

If you deploy Func on your own, refer to [Self-deployed Func](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-integration/)

> It is recommended to deploy the GSE version

### Install Script

> Note: Prepare a Huawei Cloud AK that meets the requirements in advance (for simplicity, you can directly grant global read-only permission `ReadOnlyAccess`)

To synchronize Huawei Cloud DDS monitoring data, we install the corresponding collection scripts:

- **guance_huaweicloud_dds**: Collects DDS monitoring Metrics data
- **guance_huaweicloud_dds_slowlog**: Collects DDS slow log data

After clicking 【Install】, enter the corresponding parameters: Huawei Cloud AK and Huawei Cloud account name.

Click 【Deploy Startup Script】and the system will automatically create a `Startup` script set and configure the corresponding startup script.

After the script installation is complete, find the script 「Guance Integration (Huawei Cloud-DDS Collection)」/「Guance Integration (Huawei Cloud-DDS Slow Query Log Collection)」in the 「Development」section of Func, expand and modify the script, and edit the contents of `region_projects` under `collector_configs` and `monitor_configs`, changing the region and Project ID to the actual region and Project ID, then click Save and Publish.

Additionally, you can see the corresponding automatic trigger configuration in 「Management / Automatic Trigger Configuration」. Click 【Execute】to run it immediately without waiting for the scheduled time. After a short while, you can view the execution task records and corresponding logs.

### Verification

1. In 「Management / Automatic Trigger Configuration」confirm whether the corresponding tasks have the corresponding automatic trigger configurations, and check the corresponding task records and logs for any anomalies.
2. On the Guance platform, check if there is asset information in 「Infrastructure / Custom」.
3. On the Guance platform, check if there is corresponding monitoring data in 「Metrics」.
4. On the Guance platform, check if there is corresponding slow log data in 「Logs」.
