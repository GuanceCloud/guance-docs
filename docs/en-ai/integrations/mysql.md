MySQL metrics collection gathers the following data:

- Basic data collection for MySQL Global Status
- Schema-related data
- InnoDB-related metrics
- Support for custom query data collection

## Configuration {#config}

### Prerequisites {#requirements}

- MySQL version 5.7+
- Create a monitoring account (usually requires logging in with the MySQL `root` account to create a MySQL user)

```sql
CREATE USER 'datakit'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<UNIQUEPASSWORD>';

-- For MySQL 8.0+, create the datakit user with the caching_sha2_password method
CREATE USER 'datakit'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY '<UNIQUEPASSWORD>';
```

- Authorization

```sql
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'datakit'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'datakit'@'localhost';
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'performance_schema';
GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO 'datakit'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'datakit'@'localhost';
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'datakit'@'localhost';
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
???+ attention

    - If using `localhost` and encountering the following error, change `localhost` to `::1` <br/>
    `Error 1045: Access denied for user 'datakit'@'localhost' (using password: YES)`

    - The above creation and authorization operations are limited to the `datakit` user, who can only access MySQL from the MySQL host (`localhost`). If remote collection of MySQL is required, it is recommended to replace `localhost` with `%` (indicating that DataKit can access MySQL from any machine), or use a specific DataKit installation machine address.

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Host Installation"

    Enter the `conf.d/db` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `mysql.conf.sample` and rename it to `mysql.conf`. Example as follows:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.mysql]]
      host = "localhost"
      user = "datakit"
      pass = "<PASS>"
      port = 3306
      # sock = "<SOCK>"
      # charset = "utf8"
    
      ## @param connect_timeout - number - optional - default: 10s
      # connect_timeout = "10s"
    
      ## Deprecated
      # service = "<SERVICE>"
    
      interval = "10s"
    
      ## @param inno_db
      innodb = true
    
      ## table_schema
      tables = []
    
      ## user
      users = []
    
      ## Set replication to true to collect replication metrics
      # replication = false
      ## Set group_replication to true to collect group replication metrics
      # group_replication = false
    
      ## Set dbm to true to collect database activity 
      # dbm = false
    
      ## Set true to enable election
      election = true
    
      [inputs.mysql.log]
        # #required, glob logfiles
        # files = ["/var/log/mysql/*.log"]
    
        ## glob filteer
        # ignore = [""]
    
        ## optional encodings:
        ## "utf-8", "utf-16le", "utf-16le", "gbk", "gb18030" or ""
        # character_encoding = ""
    
        ## The pattern should be a regexp. Note the use of '''this regexp'''
        ## regexp link: https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/#hdr-Syntax
        multiline_match = '''^(# Time|\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}|\d{6}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}).*'''
    
        ## grok pipeline script path
        pipeline = "mysql.p"
    
      ## Run a custom SQL query and collect corresponding metrics.
      # [[inputs.mysql.custom_queries]]
      #   sql = '''
      #     select ENGINE as engine,TABLE_SCHEMA as table_schema,count(*) as table_count 
      #     from information_schema.tables

      #   '''
      #   metric = "mysql_custom"
      #   tags = ["engine", "table_schema"]
      #   fields = ["table_count"] 
    
      ## Config dbm metric 
      [inputs.mysql.dbm_metric]
        enabled = true
      
      ## Config dbm sample 
      [inputs.mysql.dbm_sample]
        enabled = true  
    
      ## Config dbm activity
      [inputs.mysql.dbm_activity]
        enabled = true  
    
      ## TLS Config
      # [inputs.mysql.tls]
        # tls_ca = "/etc/mysql/ca.pem"
        # tls_cert = "/etc/mysql/cert.pem"
        # tls_key = "/etc/mysql/key.pem"
    
        ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
        # insecure_skip_verify = true
    
        ## By default, support TLS 1.2 and above.
        ## Set to true if server side uses TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1
        # allow_tls10 = false
    
      [inputs.mysql.tags]
        # some_tag = "some_value"
        # more_tag = "some_other_value"
    
    ```

    After configuration, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    Currently, you can enable the collector through [ConfigMap injection](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).

### Binlog Enablement {#binlog}

By default, MySQL Binlog is not enabled. To collect Binlog size statistics, you need to enable the corresponding Binlog function in MySQL:

```sql
-- ON: Enable/OFF: Disable
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
```

To enable Binlog, refer to [this Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40682381/how-do-i-enable-mysql-binary-logging){:target="_blank"} or [this Q&A](https://serverfault.com/questions/706699/enable-binlog-in-mysql-on-ubuntu){:target="_blank"}

### Database Performance Metrics Collection {#performance-schema}

The main source of database performance metrics comes from MySQL's built-in database `performance_schema`, which provides a way to obtain internal execution details of the server at runtime. Through this database, DataKit can collect various historical query statement statistics, execution plans, and other related performance metrics. The collected performance metric data is saved as logs, with sources being `mysql_dbm_metric`, `mysql_dbm_sample`, and `mysql_dbm_activity`.

To enable this, follow these steps.

- Modify the configuration file to enable monitoring collection

```toml
[[inputs.mysql]]

# Enable database performance metrics collection
dbm = true

...

# Monitoring metrics configuration
[inputs.mysql.dbm_metric]
  enabled = true

# Monitoring sampling configuration
[inputs.mysql.dbm_sample]
  enabled = true

# Waiting event collection
[inputs.mysql.dbm_activity]
  enabled = true   
...

```

- MySQL Configuration

Modify the configuration file (such as *mysql.conf*) to enable `MySQL Performance Schema` and configure relevant parameters:

```toml
[mysqld]
performance_schema = on
max_digest_length = 4096
performance_schema_max_digest_length = 4096
performance_schema_max_sql_text_length = 4096
performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-current = on
performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-current = on
performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history-long = on
performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history = on

```

- Account Configuration

Account authorization

```sql
-- MySQL 5.6 & 5.7
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO datakit@'%' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO datakit@'%';

-- MySQL >= 8.0
ALTER USER datakit@'%' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO datakit@'%';
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO datakit@'%';
```

Create database

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS datakit;
GRANT EXECUTE ON datakit.* TO datakit@'%';
GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON datakit.* TO datakit@'%';
```

Create stored procedure `explain_statement` to get SQL execution plan

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE datakit.explain_statement(IN query TEXT)
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
    SET @explain := CONCAT('EXPLAIN FORMAT=json ', query);
    PREPARE stmt FROM @explain;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
```

Create stored procedures for individual databases that require execution plan collection (optional)

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE <database_name>.explain_statement(IN query TEXT)
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
    SET @explain := CONCAT('EXPLAIN FORMAT=json ', query);
    PREPARE stmt FROM @explain;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE <database_name>.explain_statement TO datakit@'%';
```

- `consumers` Configuration

Method One (Recommended): Dynamically configure `performance_schema.events_*` through `DataKit`, requiring the creation of the following stored procedure:

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE datakit.enable_events_statements_consumers()
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
    UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name LIKE 'events_statements_%';
    UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name = 'events_waits_current';
END $$
DELIMITER ;

GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE datakit.enable_events_statements_consumers TO datakit@'%';
```

Method Two: Manually configure `consumers`

```sql
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name LIKE 'events_statements_%';
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name = 'events_waits_current';
```

### Replication Metrics Collection {#replication_metrics}

The prerequisite for collecting `mysql_replication` metrics is to have master-slave replication enabled. All `mysql_replication` metrics are collected from the slave database. To confirm whether the master-slave replication environment is normal, input the following command on the slave database:

```sql
SHOW SLAVE STATUS;
```

If both `Replica_IO_Running` and `Replica_SQL_Running` values are Yes, it indicates that the master-slave replication environment status is normal.

If you need to collect group replication metrics such as `count_transactions_in_queue`, add the group replication plugin to the list of plugins loaded by the server at startup (group replication is supported from MySQL version 5.7.17). Add the following line to the slave database configuration file `/etc/my.cnf`:

```toml
plugin_load_add ='group_replication.so'
```

You can confirm that the group replication plugin is installed via `show plugins;`.

To enable this, follow these steps.

- Modify the configuration file to enable monitoring collection

```toml
[[inputs.mysql]]

## Set replication to true to collect replication metrics
replication = true
## Set group_replication to true to collect group replication metrics
group_replication = true  
...

```

## Metrics {#metric}

All the data collected below will append the global election tag by default. You can also specify other tags in the configuration using `[inputs.mysql.tags]`:

```toml
 [inputs.mysql.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```
