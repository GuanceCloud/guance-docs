# Self-built Tracking
---

## Introduction

Guance supports you in creating tracking tasks via **RUM** to monitor custom tracing paths in real time. By predefining tracing paths, you can filter trace data centrally, accurately query user experience, and promptly identify vulnerabilities, anomalies, and risks.

## Application Support

The tracking feature currently only supports Web, Android, and iOS applications.

## Create a New Tracking Task

In the Guance workspace under **RUM**, click on the **application name** to enter the specified application, and then create a new tracking path through **Tracking**.

When performing **Create New Tracking**, you need to set the name and fields, and after generating the tracking ID, complete the integration configuration.

| Field      | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Tracking Name       | The name of the current tracking task. Supports mixed Chinese and English writing, underscores as separators, no other special characters, and up to 64 characters.  |
| Tags       | Define tracing fields. Supports selecting tags (key:value) from the current application (app_id) via a dropdown box, with multiple selections allowed. |
| Tracking ID    | A unique system-generated tracking ID, supporting one-click copying by users. |
| Integration Method     | After generating the tracking ID, you need to integrate the code into the application based on the tracking ID information.                          |

## Manage Tracking Tasks

After creating a tracking task, it is started by default. You can view performance data for the specified tracking ID in the Session Explorer of the current application; you can also view data generated by the tracking by clicking the tracking **name**. Additionally, you can view or delete tracking tasks.


## Automated Tracking {#auto-tracking}

Guance supports using **browser extensions** to record user access behavior, creating codeless end-to-end tests.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Download Browser Extension

1. If you have already integrated a Web application, you can directly download and install the [browser extension](https://static.guance.com/guance-plugin/guance-rum-plugin.zip).

2. If you haven't started using Guance yet, complete the following steps first:

 - [Register for a Guance account](https://www.guance.com/);  
 - [Install DataKit](../datakit/datakit-install.md);  
 - [Enable RUM Collector](../integrations/rum.md);  
 - [Integrate Web Application](web/app-access.md).

#### Step 2: Install the Extension

1. After downloading the extension, visit `chrome://extensions/` in your browser;

**Note**: Automated tracking currently supports Chrome and Edge browsers.

2. Enable **Developer Mode**;

3. Unzip the downloaded browser extension [guance-rum-plugin.zip](https://static.guance.com/guance-plugin/guance-rum-plugin.zip);

4. Click **Load Unpacked**;

- Click the :fontawesome-solid-clock-rotate-left: icon to view previously generated tracking IDs;
- Click the **Language** icon to view or switch languages;
- Click the :octicons-question-24: icon to view help documentation.

#### Step 4: Filter and View Data in Guance

In the RUM application list, select the integrated Web application, and you can filter and view user access data using the tracking ID (`track_id`) generated by the plugin.
