# Custom Tracking
---

## Introduction

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> supports you in creating tracking tasks through **RUM** to monitor custom trace data in real time. By predefining trace data, you can filter trace information centrally, accurately query user experience, and promptly identify vulnerabilities, anomalies, and risks.

## Application Support

The tracking feature currently supports Web, Android, and iOS applications.

## Create Tracking

In the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> workspace under **RUM**, click on the **Application Name** to enter the specified application, and then create a new tracking trace via **Tracking**.

When performing **Create Tracking**, you need to set the name and fields, and after generating the tracking ID, complete the integration configuration.

| Field      | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Tracking Name       | The name of the current tracking task. Supports mixed Chinese and English characters, underscores as separators, no other special characters, and up to 64 characters.  |
| Tags       | Define trace fields. Supports selecting tags (key:value) from the current application (app_id) via a dropdown box, with multiple selections allowed. |
| Tracking ID    | A system-generated unique tracking ID that supports one-click copying by users. |
| Integration Method     | After generating the tracking ID, you need to integrate the code into the application based on the tracking ID information.                          |

## Manage Tracking Tasks

After creating a tracking task, it is enabled by default. You can view performance data for the specified tracking ID in the Session Explorer of the current application; you can also view data generated by the tracking by clicking on the tracking **Name**. Additionally, you can view or delete tracking tasks.
