# iOS/tvOS Application Analysis
---

## Introduction

After collecting application data into Guance, you can view the analysis of application performance through the Guance console.

## Explorer Analysis

Guance provides a RUM Explorer to help you view and analyze detailed information about user visits to your applications. Within the Guance workspace, open **User Analysis**, click on any application, and use the **Explorer** to understand each user session, page performance, resources, long tasks, errors in operations, delays affecting users, and more. This allows you to gain a comprehensive understanding and improve the operational status and usage of your application, enhancing user experience. For more details, refer to the [Explorer](../explorer/index.md) documentation.

## Scenario Analysis

Guance offers visualized iOS application analysis with built-in monitoring solutions for various iOS applications. You can navigate to **User Analysis** - «Analysis Dashboard» - «Mobile», select the iOS **Application ID**, and view the summary, performance analysis, resource analysis, and error analysis.

### Summary

The summary of iOS applications provides statistics on launches, PV count, page error rate, page load time, session analysis, performance analysis, and error analysis. It visually displays user visit data for iOS applications from aspects such as app startup, session distribution, user devices, popular pages ranking, page visits ranking, and resource error ranking. This helps quickly identify issues with user visits to iOS applications and improve user visit performance. You can filter by environment and version to view connected iOS applications.
