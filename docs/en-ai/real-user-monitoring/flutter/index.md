## Invocation Principle
Third-party framework SDK depends on the native SDK
### SDK Structure

- AutoTrack handles native application behavior, thereby automatically generating RUM, Log, and Trace data
- Open API provides external interfaces
- DataSync is the data synchronization module, which syncs data to Datakit
