# Android Application Analysis
---

## Introduction

After collecting application data into Guance, you can view the application performance analysis through the Guance console.

## Explorer Analysis

Guance provides a RUM Explorer to help you view and analyze detailed information about user visits to your application. Within the Guance workspace, open **User Access Monitoring**, and click on any application to use the **Explorer** to understand each user session, page performance, resources, long tasks, errors in operations, delays affecting users, and more. This helps you gain a comprehensive understanding of and improve the operational status and usage of your application, enhancing user experience. For more details, refer to the [Explorer](../explorer/index.md) documentation.

## Scenario Analysis

Guance offers visualized Android application analysis with built-in monitoring solutions for various Android applications. You can choose the Android **Application ID** under **User Access Monitoring** - "Analysis Dashboard" - "Mobile", to view summaries, performance analysis, resource analysis, and error analysis.

### Summary

The summary scene of an Android application statistically tracks metrics such as launch counts, PV numbers, page error rates, page load times, session analysis, performance analysis, and error analysis. It visually presents data statistics on user access to Android applications from aspects like application launches, session distribution, visiting user devices, popular page rankings, page visit rankings, and resource error rankings. This allows for quick identification of issues in user access to Android applications and improves user access performance. You can filter by environment and version to view connected Android applications.

### Performance Analysis

Performance analysis of Android applications involves tracking metrics such as PV numbers, page load times, most visited page sessions, page long task analysis, and resource analysis. This provides real-time visualization of overall Android application page performance, helping to precisely identify pages that need optimization. You can filter by environment and version to view connected Android applications.

### Resource Analysis

Resource analysis of Android applications involves tracking metrics such as resource classification, XHR & Fetch analysis, and resource timing analysis. This provides real-time visualization of overall Android application resource conditions and helps precisely identify resources that need optimization by analyzing resource request rankings. You can filter by environment and version to view connected Android applications.

### Error Analysis

JavaScript error analysis of Android applications involves tracking metrics such as error rates, crashes, crash versions, and network error status distributions. This provides real-time visualization of overall Android application error conditions and helps quickly identify resource errors through affected resource error statistics. You can filter by environment and version to view connected Android applications.
