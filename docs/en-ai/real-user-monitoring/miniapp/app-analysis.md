# Mini Program Application Analysis
---

## Introduction

After collecting application data into Guance, you can view the APM analysis through the Guance console.

## Explorer Analysis

Guance provides an RUM Explorer to help you view and analyze detailed information about user access to applications. Within the Guance workspace, open **User Access Monitoring**, click on any application, and you can use the **Explorer** to understand each user session, page performance, resources, long tasks, errors in operations, delays affecting users, and more. This helps you gain a comprehensive understanding of and improve the operational status and usage of your application through search, filtering, and correlation analysis, enhancing user experience. For more details, refer to the [Explorer](../explorer/index.md) documentation.

## Scenario Analysis

Guance provides visual mini program application analysis with built-in monitoring solutions for various mini program applications. You can view overviews, performance analysis, resource analysis, and error analysis under **User Access Monitoring** - "Analysis Dashboard" - "Mini Program".

### Overview

The overview scene of mini program applications statistically analyzes the number of app launches, PV counts, page error rates, page load times, startup analysis, session analysis, performance analysis, and error analysis. It visually presents data statistics on user visits to mini programs from aspects such as app launch, session distribution, visiting user devices, popular page rankings, page visit volume rankings, and resource error rankings. This allows for quick identification of issues with user visits to mini programs and improves user visit performance. You can filter by environment and version to view connected mini programs.

### Performance Analysis

Performance analysis of mini program applications involves statistical metrics such as PV counts, page load time, first render time, segmented duration, most visited page sessions, page long task analysis, and resource analysis. It provides real-time visualization of overall mini program application page performance, enabling more precise identification of pages that need optimization. You can filter by environment and version to view connected mini programs.

### Resource Analysis

Resource analysis of mini program applications involves statistical metrics like resource classification, XHR & Fetch analysis, and resource timing analysis. It provides real-time visualization of overall mini program application resource conditions. By analyzing resource request rankings, it enables more precise identification of resources that need optimization. You can filter by environment and version to view connected mini programs.

### Error Analysis

JS error analysis of mini program applications involves statistical metrics such as error rates, error classifications, error versions, and network error status distributions. It provides real-time visualization of overall mini program application error conditions. Through affected resource error statistics, it quickly identifies resource errors. You can filter by environment and version to view connected mini programs.
