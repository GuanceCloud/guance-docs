By quickly sending abnormal events to PagerDuty to create incidents, we gain better capabilities for managing and tracking abnormal events, thus ensuring the normal operation of the system. Additionally, this method also helps us better analyze and solve problems, improving the stability and reliability of the system.

    - monitor_jira: When our application or system encounters an anomaly, timely handling is usually required to ensure normal operation. To better manage and track abnormal events, we can send these events to Jira to create incidents, allowing us to track, analyze, and resolve these issues within Jira. By quickly sending abnormal events to Jira to create incidents, we gain better capabilities for managing and tracking abnormal events, thus ensuring the normal operation of the system. Additionally, this method also helps us better analyze and solve problems, improving the stability and reliability of the system.
