### Deployment Plan Update {#deployment1225}

#### Launcher Update

1. Kubernetes Operation History

    - All Kubernetes change operations now support version history for better traceability and management.

2. New Workload Management Features

    - Supports adjusting the number of Workload replicas.
    - Supports modifying the Workload image address.
    - Supports configuring resource limits (Limit), taints (Taint), affinity settings, etc., for Workloads.
    - Supports rolling back Workloads to historical versions and comparing differences between versions with one click.

3. Launcher Service Management

    - Added a feature to directly shut down Launcher services within the Launcher interface.

4. Registry Key Configuration Sync

    - After modifying the Registry Key configuration, it will automatically synchronize and update the pre-configured `registry-key` Secret in Kubernetes.

5. Deployment Security Enhancement

    - During new deployments, the backend admin account password must be manually entered during the installation information collection phase to ensure security.

6. UI Optimization

    - Icons have been added to all function menus to enhance visual effects and improve user experience.

#### Feature Updates

1. The Deployment Plan supports [customizing navigation bar and operation button display text](../../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Backend Member Menu Optimization:

    - Added a "Login Type" column to distinguish default login members from SSO login members and support filtering by login type;
    - For SSO login members, supports editing "Other Attributes" fields, allowing customizable attribute information. This information is synchronized to Webhook notifications and corresponding event content areas when sending alerts.

3. For workspaces using Volcano Engine as the main storage engine, the storage policies for tracing, logs, and custom log indexes have been adjusted to Standard Storage, Low-Frequency Storage, and Archive Storage, which can be configured separately for hot data, low-frequency data, and archive data retention periods. Additionally, when creating new indexes in <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console, the storage policy is also adjusted accordingly.

### OpenAPI Update {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports obtaining a list of resource catalogs and supports [creating](../../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modifying](../../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[deleting](../../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[exporting](../../open-api/objc-set/export.md) resource viewers.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metric sets and supports [adding](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modifying](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enabling/disabling](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[deleting](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) metrics.

### Feature Updates {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automatic Writing of [Pipeline](../../pipeline/index.md): Traditional log parsing methods often rely on familiarity with rules for manual script writing, which not only consumes a lot of time but also easily leads to errors, resulting in low efficiency in writing Pipelines and inability to respond and solve problems in a timely manner. To improve efficiency and reduce labor costs, this feature leverages the natural language processing capabilities of large models to assist in automated log content parsing, helping developers write Pipelines more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large amounts of logs, simplifying data flow and processing.

#### Monitoring

AI Alert Compression and Merging: Through large models compressing and merging monitoring alert events, reducing redundancy, especially when the system generates a large number of alerts in a short period. By consolidating alert events, ensuring that operation and maintenance personnel receive only one comprehensive alert message within a specified time cycle (such as 10 minutes), rather than multiple duplicate alert messages.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

Cloud billing scenario views and viewers have added currency category displays for consumption.

#### Scenarios

1. Dashboards, built-in views added [ID identifier](../../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely determined through ID identifiers. When configuring jump links in charts, you can locate dashboards or user views via ID identifiers.
2. Adjusted [automatic refresh](../../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#refresh) logic for viewers: Removed the "pause" button in the time component, added an "off" option in the refresh frequency options, allowing users to turn off auto-refresh as needed for simpler and more intuitive operations. At the same time, removed the "auto-refresh for viewer" switch in personal settings to avoid redundant functionality and optimize user settings experience.
3. Added function `MD5()` to viewers, supporting querying desensitized log data encrypted by MD5 in viewers.
4. Chart Optimization: Charts support obtaining PromQL metric names as legends and using `{__name__}` to configure aliases for metric names.
5. PromQL Editor added syntax highlighting and syntax hints.

#### Metrics

Optimization of [Generated Metrics](../../metrics/generate-metrics.md):

1. Integrated all types of generated metrics under the metrics catalog for easier unified viewing and management by users.
2. Supported re-aggregating existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing more dimensions for data analysis.

#### Management

Optimization of data access and sensitive data viewing desensitization rule application: Optimized multi-rule and multi-role combined overlay data viewing scope. If a member has multiple roles, the final data access scope takes the union of the defined scopes in the rules, and the sensitive data viewing desensitization rules follow the same principle.

#### Infrastructure

Resource Catalog [Cross Workspace Query](../../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace): In the resource catalog menu, support cross-workspace query of resource list data.

### <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Deployment Plan Update {#onpremise1211}

1. When modifying the Registry Key configuration in Launcher, the corresponding registry-key configuration in k8s will be updated in real-time.

### Feature Updates {#feature1211}

#### Scenarios

1. [Topology Map](../../scene/visual-chart/topology-map.md) adds external data query: Allows users to visualize topology maps by integrating external data through DataFlux Func. Users just need to connect data according to the chart structure to easily achieve visualization of external data.
2. [Charts](../../scene/visual-chart/index.md#type) Optimization
    - Improved chart display effects: Optimized chart display effects, adjusted to slide-out listings, categorized displays, making chart finding and usage more convenient.
    - Display of chart descriptions and applicable scenarios: Added display of chart descriptions and applicable scenarios in the chart list, helping users better understand and choose appropriate chart types.
3. View Variable Optimization
    - Support for configuring upper limits for view variable values to prevent excessive data listing causing page loading performance issues.
    - Default upper limit for deployment plans is 50, supporting customizable default listing numbers. Note: Page configuration restrictions take precedence over global restrictions.

#### Infrastructure

1. Resource Catalog Optimization:
    - Added grouping function: To improve resource management efficiency, a new resource grouping function has been added. Users can group resources with common characteristics for easier management and viewing, thereby optimizing resource organization structures.
    - Optimized Explorer Hive Chart Mode: Supports configuring "color fill" and "group analysis" fields, allowing users to customize optional fields as needed.
2. Container and Resource Catalog Viewer Search Optimization: Added `container_name` search for container viewers and `name` search for resource catalogs.

#### Monitoring

Alert Policy Configuration Optimization

- Supports [one-click creation of associated monitors](../../monitoring/alert-setting.md#with_monitor) via the alert policy entry point, adding a unified alert notification management model centered around alert policies.
- Optimized interactive display of associated monitors in the alert policy list.

#### RUM

RUM has added support for React Native application types and allows uploading SourceMaps for data parsing and restoration. If you need to upload SourceMaps for React Native applications originally created under Android/iOS types, note:

1. When creating a new application, select the "React Native" application type. You can directly copy the name and application ID of existing React Native applications under Android/iOS types and then click the "Create" button. After completion, you can configure SourceMaps under this application. This change only involves the creation method of React Native applications and does not affect data collection.

2. If your existing React Native applications under Android/iOS types are associated with monitors and you have not yet recreated identical ID React Native applications under the "React Native" type, the original monitors can continue to work normally. However, if you have already recreated "React Native" type applications, the original monitors will fail to obtain data in the "Application Name" field and display as empty. In such cases, you need to select "React Native" as the application type and resave the monitor.

#### APM

APM installation guidance added [automatic injection method](../../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM (APM) installation guidance, a new Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method has been added. This method simplifies the APM deployment process, enabling users to install and use it more quickly in Kubernetes environments.


### New Integrations {#inte1211}

- Added [HBASE region](../../integrations/hbase_region.md) integration;
- Added [HBASE master](../../integrations/hbase_master.md) integration;
- Optimized [NodeExporter](../../integrations/node-exporter.md) integration views;
- Added [Huawei Cloud DCAAS dedicated line](../../integrations/huawei_dcaas.md) integration;
- Adjusted K8S dashboard;
- Updated [memcached](../../integrations/memcached.md) views and monitors;
- Updated [rabbitmq](../../integrations/rabbitmq.md) views and monitors.

### Bug Fixes {#bug1211}

1. Fixed the issue of abnormal expression query values;
2. Fixed the issue where data was visible in the time series graph but not in the chart query when querying CPU usage rate for pods started at a specific moment using PromQL in charts.
