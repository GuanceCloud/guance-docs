### Deployment Plan Updates {#deployment1225}

#### Launcher Updates

1. Kubernetes Operation History

    - All changes to Kubernetes now support version history records for traceability and management.

2. New Workload Management Features

    - Support for adjusting the number of Workload replicas.
    - Support for modifying the Workload image address.
    - Support for configuring resource limits (Limit), taints (Taint), affinity (Affinity), etc., for Workloads.
    - Support for rolling back Workloads to historical versions with version difference comparisons.

3. Launcher Service Management

    - Added a feature to directly shut down the Launcher service from the Launcher interface.

4. Registry Key Configuration Sync

    - After modifying the Registry Key configuration, it will automatically update the pre-configured `registry-key` Secret in Kubernetes.

5. Enhanced Deployment Security

    - During new deployments, the backend admin account password must be manually entered during the installation information collection phase to ensure security.

6. UI Optimization

    - All function menus have added icon identifiers to enhance visual effects and improve user experience.

#### Feature Updates

1. The Deployment Plan supports [customizing navigation bar and operation button display text](../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Optimization of the Management Backend Member Menu:

    - Added a "Login Type" column, supporting differentiation between default login members and SSO login members, and allowing filtering by login type;
    - For SSO login members, editing of "Other Attributes" fields is supported, enabling customizable attribute information. This information will be synchronized to Webhook notifications and corresponding event content areas when sending alerts.

3. Main storage engine for workspaces using Volcano Engine: Chain, log, and custom log index storage policies are adjusted to Standard Storage, Infrequent Access Storage, and Archive Storage, which can be configured separately for hot data, infrequent data, and archive data retention periods. If the main storage engine is Volcano Engine, when creating a new index in the Guance console, the storage policy is also adjusted accordingly.

### OpenAPI Updates {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports obtaining a list of resource catalogs, and [creating](../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modifying](../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[deleting](../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[exporting](../open-api/objc-set/export.md) Explorer views.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metric lists, and [creating](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modifying](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enabling/disabling](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[deleting](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) metrics.

### Feature Updates {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automatic Writing of [Pipeline](../pipeline/index.md): Traditional log parsing methods often rely on familiarity with rules for manual script writing, which not only consumes a lot of time but also easily leads to errors, reducing the efficiency of writing Pipelines and making it difficult to respond and solve problems in a timely manner. To improve efficiency and reduce labor costs, this feature leverages large models' natural language processing capabilities to assist in automating log content parsing, helping developers write Pipelines more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large volumes of logs, simplifying data flows and processing procedures.

#### Monitoring

AI Alert Compression and Merging: By compressing and merging monitoring alert events through large models, redundant alerts, especially those generated in large quantities within a short period, are reduced. Through the consolidation of alert events, it ensures that operations personnel receive only one comprehensive alert message within a specified time cycle (e.g., 10 minutes), rather than multiple duplicate alert messages.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

Cloud billing scenario views and Explorers add currency category displays.

#### Scenario

1. Dashboards, built-in views add [ID markers](../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely determined via ID markers, and jump links can be configured in charts to locate dashboards or user views.
2. Adjusted [auto-refresh](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#refresh) logic for Explorers: Removed the "Pause" button in the time component, added an "off" option in the refresh frequency options, allowing users to turn off auto-refresh as needed, making operations simpler and more intuitive. At the same time, removed the "Explorer Auto-Refresh" switch in personal settings to avoid functional redundancy and optimize the user settings experience.
3. Added function `MD5()` to Explorers, supporting querying desensitized log data encrypted by MD5 in Explorers.
4. Chart optimization: Charts now support obtaining PromQL metric names as legends, using `{__name__}` to configure metric names as aliases for display.
5. PromQL editor adds syntax highlighting and syntax hints.

#### Metrics

[Generate Metrics](../metrics/generate-metrics.md) optimization:

1. Consolidated all types of generated metrics under the metrics catalog for easier viewing and management by users.
2. Supported re-aggregation of existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing more dimensions for data analysis.

#### Management

Optimized application of data access and sensitive data view desensitization rules: Optimized multi-rule and multi-role combined stacking data view range. If a member has multiple roles, the final data access range takes the union of the defined ranges within the rules, and the desensitization rules for sensitive data views follow the same principle.

#### Infrastructure

[Cross-workspace query](../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace) for resource catalogs: In the resource catalog menu, cross-workspace queries of resource list data are supported.

### Guance Deployment Plan Updates {#onpremise1211}

1. After modifying the Registry Key configuration in Launcher, the corresponding registry-key configuration in k8s will be updated in real-time.

### Feature Updates {#feature1211}

#### Scenario

1. [Topology Map](../scene/visual-chart/topology-map.md) adds external data queries: Allows users to visualize topology maps using external data via DataFlux Func. Users only need to connect data according to the chart structure to easily achieve visualization of external data.
2. [Chart](../scene/visual-chart/index.md#type) optimization
    - Improved chart display effects: Optimized the display effect of charts, changed to side-sliding listings, categorized displays, making chart finding and use more convenient.
    - Added chart descriptions and applicable scenarios: Increased the display of chart descriptions and applicable scenarios in the chart list, helping users better understand and choose suitable chart types.
3. View variable optimization
    - Added upper limit configuration for view variable values to avoid performance issues caused by excessive data listings.
    - Default upper limit for deployment plan is 50, supporting customizable default listing numbers. Note: Page configuration restrictions take precedence over global restrictions.

#### Infrastructure

1. Resource catalog optimization:
    - Added grouping functionality: To improve resource management efficiency, a new resource grouping feature was added. Users can group similar resources for easier management and viewing, optimizing the organization structure of resources.
    - Optimized cell chart mode for resource catalog viewer: Supports configuring "color fill" and "group analysis" field lists, allowing users to customize optional fields as needed.
2. Container and resource catalog viewer search optimization: Added `container_name` search for container viewers and `name` search for resource catalogs.

#### Monitoring

Alert strategy configuration optimization

- Supports [one-click creation of associated monitors](../monitoring/alert-setting.md#with_monitor) through the alert strategy entry point, adding a unified alert notification management model centered around alert strategies.
- Optimized interaction for associated display of alert strategies in the alert strategy list.

#### RUM

RUM added support for React Native application types and allows uploading SourceMap for data parsing and restoration. If you need to upload SourceMap for React Native applications originally created under Android/iOS types, note:

1. When creating a new application, select the "React Native" application type. You can directly copy the name and application ID of existing React Native applications under Android/iOS types, then click the "Create" button. After creation, you can configure SourceMap under this application. This change only involves the creation method of React Native applications and does not affect data collection.

2. If your previously created React Native applications under Android/iOS types have associated monitors and you have not recreated the same ID React Native application under the "React Native" type, the original monitors can continue to work normally. However, if you have already recreated the "React Native" type application, the original monitors will not be able to retrieve data in the "Application Name" item and will display as empty. In this case, you need to select the "React Native" application type and resave this monitor.

#### APM

APM installation guide added [automatic injection method](../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM (APM) installation guide, a new Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method was added. This method simplifies the APM deployment process, allowing users to install and use it faster in Kubernetes environments.

    This version depends on version v1.9.3 of the GuanceDB for logs engine. Please upgrade the GuanceDB for logs engine components guance-select and guance-insert to at least v1.9.3.

### Deployment Plan Updates

1. Added Monitor List Menu in the Management Backend: Lists all monitors across workspaces, supporting search, filter, modification of monitor enable/disable status, deletion, export of monitors, and cloning single/batch monitors to selected workspaces.
    - Note: Composite detection monitors do not support cross-workspace cloning.
2. Optimized MFA Security Authentication: Added a switch to hide the 7-day auto-login option, supporting configuration of whether to enable the auto-login option.
3. CDN Domain Configuration: Can configure CDN domain names in configuration files, and the RUM application access page will automatically fetch and display them.

### Feature Updates {#feature1030}

#### Cloud Billing

Added [Primary Navigation](../cloud-billing/index.md) menu, presetting viewers and bill analysis views for cloud billing data, optimizing user viewing experience.

Note: Not supported in Free Plan.

#### Monitoring

1. [Host Intelligent Monitoring](../monitoring/intelligent-monitoring/host-intelligent-detection.md) Added Network Detection Extension: Based on host-based network monitoring, it provides efficient network performance monitoring, helping users monitor host network traffic in real-time, identify abnormal traffic and potential connection issues, and promptly warn to prevent affecting normal business operations. The system supports multi-dimensional visualization functions, helping users deeply analyze and understand host network usage, optimizing bandwidth allocation and resource utilization, and providing data support for future capacity planning to ensure reasonable network resource configuration.
2. Monitor Function Enhancements:
    - Supports batch setting of associated alert strategies in the monitor list.
    
    - Log viewers can [one-click configure](../logs/manag-explorer.md) [Log Detection] type monitors based on current filtering and search conditions.
    
    - Note: Only when both site and workspace levels have enabled `left*` queries, monitors support `left*` queries. Otherwise, if a log viewer configures `left*` queries, jumping to the monitor will result in query errors.

3. [Notification Object](../monitoring/notify-object.md) List:
    - Added search and quick filter functions, supporting fast retrieval of notification objects;
    - For notification objects that have been disabled by the system due to consecutive two-day failures, a mark is added after their names.

4. [Silent Rule](../monitoring/silent-management.md) Optimization:
    - Added configuration functions for rule names and descriptions, enhancing rule management convenience;
    - Event attributes support logical combinations of different fields (AND and OR);
    - Optimized list display effects, supporting customizable display columns, enhancing personalized user interface experiences.

5. [Alert Strategy](../monitoring/alert-setting.md):
    - Tag matching logic in notification rules supports free combinations of AND and OR relationships between different fields, with interaction experience consistent with the filter/search component of viewers;
    - Added custom operation permission configuration;
    - Added filling of alert strategy descriptions.

#### Scenarios

1. Added Host NET Analysis View: By aggregating indicators such as host network usage, bandwidth allocation, and resource utilization, it provides data support for future capacity planning to ensure reasonable network resource allocation.
2. Chart Query Optimization:
    - `index` does not support `by` group queries, optimizing DQL query interaction experience;
    - By tag range / filter tag range lists are precise to the metric level;
    - DQL query added a function to query log indexes: `show_logging_index()`, which can be applied in dashboard view variables, and chart query index configuration supports view variable filling;
    - Chart expression query function now supports cross-space queries;
    - Optimized combined chart time locking display, providing a more intuitive user experience.
3. Viewer Page Optimization: Added `host_ip` display to the bound host tab in the viewer detail page.

#### Pipeline

[Pipeline](../pipeline/index.md) Text Processing Optimization: Isolated "Local Pipeline" and "Central Pipeline," allowing different types of data source processing scripts to be added. Added prompt information to help users better understand processing differences.

#### Management

[Integrated Data Access](../management/logdata-access.md) Function:

- Added data access functionality for application performance and metrics;
- Added a "Data Access" function module in management,
