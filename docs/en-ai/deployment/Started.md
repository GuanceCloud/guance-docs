### Prerequisites
???+ warning "Important"
    - **Before starting the deployment, please ensure that all prerequisites are met and carefully read the following deployment manual content.**
    - **The related offline packages in this document currently only support CentOS 7 x86_64 architecture.**
    - **The current version of Guance requires a properly functioning NFS server.**
    - **Ensure that the time zones of all nodes are set consistently and that times are synchronized.**
    - **All commands in the document should be executed with root privileges by default.**
    - **Ensure installation starts on a clean system; do not use systems that have previously installed kubeadm or other Kubernetes distributions.**
    - **Upload the basic environment offline resource package to all cluster nodes and extract it to the /etc directory on the server.**
    - **SSH passwordless login must be configured between the deployment node and other cluster nodes (including the deployment node itself).**
    - **Upload the Guance platform offline resource package to all cluster nodes and import it into the container runtime environment (containerd).**
    - **Before executing the one-click installation, configure and check the configuration files generated by the custom cluster. Mainly /etc/kubeasz/clusters/xxx/hosts and /etc/kubeasz/clusters/config.yaml.**
    - **Modify hostnames for easier identification [Optional]**
