Guance provides the Deployment Plan based on the actual usage scenarios and characteristics of customer application systems. This supports users installing and running Guance system software in their local infrastructure environment or private cloud environment.

## Deployment Plan

The Deployment Plan is obtained through subscription or purchase of a license, providing you with a local installation package and authorization for the Guance platform to create your Exclusive Plan. During the service period, Guance will continuously provide upgrade packages and online support services to ensure your platform can be upgraded to the latest version.
