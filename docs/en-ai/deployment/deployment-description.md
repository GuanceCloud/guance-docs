# Product Deployment Instructions
---

Guance Deployment Plan supports users in installing and running the Guance system software on their local infrastructure or private cloud environments. The Deployment Plan is available in subscription-based, license-based, and pay-as-you-go versions.

“Guance” is a cloud service platform designed to provide full-stack observability for applications in the era of cloud computing and cloud-native technologies. Developed by Shanghai Guance Future since 2018, the platform aims to serve numerous Chinese development teams working on cloud-based projects. Compared to complex and variable open-source products like ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, and Skywalking, “Guance” not only provides monitoring services but also offers comprehensive observability solutions. It integrates all cloud and cloud-native related technology stacks, making it easy for any project team to use without needing to invest significant effort in studying or modifying immature open-source products. Additionally, “Guance” charges based on data volume generated by users, eliminating the need for hardware investment. For paying customers, we provide a professional service team to help build core data protection systems with features such as real-time, flexibility, scalability, and ease of deployment. It supports both cloud SaaS and on-premises deployment modes.
