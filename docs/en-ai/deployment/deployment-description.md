<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Deployment Plan allows users to install <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> system software and run services on their local infrastructure or private cloud environments. The Deployment Plan is available in subscription-based, license-based, and pay-as-you-go versions.

“<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>” is a cloud service platform designed to provide full-stack observability for applications in the era of cloud computing and cloud-native systems. Developed by Shanghai Guance Future since 2018, “<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>” aims to serve a wide range of cloud-based development projects in China. Compared to complex and variable open-source products like ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, Skywalking, etc., “<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>” not only provides monitoring but also offers comprehensive observability services. It integrates all cloud and cloud-native related technology stacks, allowing project teams to use our product easily without needing to invest significant effort in researching or modifying immature open-source products. Moreover, “<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>” charges based on usage, entirely according to the data volume generated by users, eliminating the need for hardware investment. For paying customers, we establish professional service teams to help build core data protection systems with features such as real-time, flexibility, scalability, and ease of deployment, supporting both cloud SaaS and on-premises deployment modes.
