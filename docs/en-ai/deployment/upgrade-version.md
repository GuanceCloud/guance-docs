# Upgrade to Commercial Plan
---

Guance Free Plan provides a simple yet fully-featured local deployment platform for teachers, students, cloud computing enthusiasts, and other community users. You can apply for and download it for free, set up your own Guance platform, and experience the complete product features.

The Guance Free Plan supports upgrades to the Commercial Plan, which is divided into subscription-based, license-based, and pay-as-you-go versions.

## Upgrade to Pay-as-You-Go Version

After upgrading from the Guance Free Plan to the Commercial Pay-as-You-Go version, charges will be based on the number of DK (DataKit) installations. A DataKit is Guance's real-time data collector that must be deployed in the user's own IT environment to collect data. Each DK costs 5 yuan per day. If the number of reporting DKs is less than 20, it will be charged as if there were 20 DKs.

### Select Upgrade Version

In the [Guance Billing Center](https://boss.guance.com/#/signin), click “Upgrade Commercial Plan,” then under “Version Upgrade,” select “Commercial Plan - Pay-as-You-Go,” and click “Upgrade Now.”

**Note**:

1. If the License is not activated, data queries will not be available.
2. Keep the data gateway address with **`?token={}`** as-is; do not remove it or fill in any specific token. The **`{}`** is just a placeholder.

### Precautions

After upgrading your account to the “Commercial Plan - Pay-as-You-Go” in the [Guance Billing Center](https://boss.guance.com/#/signin), Guance provides a 7-day free trial period during which you can activate the Free Plan to the Commercial Plan by replacing the Free Plan License with the Commercial Plan License in the “Guance Activation” dialog box of the Guance Launcher.

- If you do not activate the Commercial Plan within 7 days, your account in the [Guance Billing Center](https://boss.guance.com/#/signin) will automatically downgrade to a Free Plan account.
- If you activate the Commercial Plan after 7 days, Guance will charge according to the “Commercial Plan - Pay-as-You-Go” billing method, and your account in the [Guance Billing Center](https://boss.guance.com/#/signin) will automatically upgrade to a Commercial Plan account.
