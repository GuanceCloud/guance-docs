# RUM Headless

RUM is used to collect user access monitoring (RUM) data reported from web or mobile ends. Guance provides a one-click activation service for RUM. After activation, it automatically installs and deploys on Guance's cloud hosts, completing a series of operations such as automatic DataKit installation and RUM collector deployment.

**Note**: The prerequisite for activating the autometa func platform is to contact the billing center to enable the whitelist channel. You need to contact your account manager and provide information such as the site and ID of the workspace.

## One-Click Activation {#steps}
