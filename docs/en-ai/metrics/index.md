# Metrics
---


Guance has comprehensive data collection capabilities. Metric data collected by collectors is automatically reported to the dashboard, where you can use **Metrics** to uniformly analyze and manage metric data within the workspace.

## Use Cases

Ensuring system observability, maintainability, and operability is crucial for organizations as they are key to ensuring business continuity and service delivery. Therefore, it becomes particularly important to use a wide range of metrics to measure the operational status and service efficiency of systems, applications, and businesses.

1. Achieve metric observation needs for various technology stacks, open-source software, and business requirements;
2. Visualize and analyze trends in metric changes;
3. Uniformly manage Mearsurements, metrics, and labels.

<!--
## Function Introduction

- **[Metric Analysis](./explorer.md)**: Supports visual query of metric data using **simple queries**, **expression queries**, **DQL queries**, and **PromQL queries**.
- **[Metric Management](./dictionary.md)**: Provides a unified view of all Mearsurements, metrics, tags, Time Series counts, and metric data retention policies within the current workspace. Here, you can also manually set the unit of metrics and add descriptions.

## Steps

- Step 1: Before using the **Metrics** feature, you need to enable relevant integrations for [metric collection](./collection.md) via DataKit. Successfully collected metric data will be automatically reported to the dashboard.
- Step 2: All metric data reported by the DataKit collector can be viewed through **Metric Management**, including Mearsurements, metrics (metric names, field types, units, descriptions), and tags.
- Step 3: All metric data within the workspace can be queried and analyzed visually through **Metrics** and **Dashboards** in the console.
