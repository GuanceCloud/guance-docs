## Data Collection

Prerequisite: [DataKit is installed](../datakit/datakit-install.md).

There are two ways to collect metrics:

1. Log in to the console, go to the **Integration** page, install DataKit, and then enable the collectors for the metrics you need to collect;
2. Use the [DataKit API](../datakit/apis.md) to customize the [writing of metrics data](https://func.guance.com/doc/practice-write-data-via-datakit/).
