:material-chat-question: Can a monitor be shared with others?

Yes.

In the [Monitor List](./monitor/index.md#list), you can share monitors by exporting or importing them.

:material-chat-question: How to understand the **Event Attributes** in mute rules?

When a monitor detects an incident, it will send an alert notification. At this point, you can configure alert muting **based on event dimensions**:

When setting up mute rules, you can configure event attributes, which means setting labels for the current mute rule. For example, if four hosts A, B, C, and D all generate incidents but you do not want to receive alerts from host C, you can enter `host:C` in the event attributes. In this case, when the monitor captures an incident alert, it will filter based on the configured attributes and only send alerts for hosts A, B, and D.

:material-chat-question: Why does configuring a 3-minute no-data alert frequently result in false alarms?

If you are using the [Infrastructure Liveness Detection](./monitor/infrastructure-detection.md) type of monitor rule, Guance currently determines liveness by checking the reporting (or update time) of infrastructure object data. Infrastructure objects report data every 5 minutes, meaning each data update interval is 5 minutes. If you configure the detection frequency to 1 minute and set it to trigger an alert if there's no data for 3 minutes, it may trigger an alert that does not meet user expectations.

For higher-frequency detections, please prioritize using metrics with higher reporting frequencies for liveness detection. Currently, you can use [Threshold Detection](./monitor/threshold-detection.md) for related configurations.

:material-chat-question: When configuring an alert strategy, how can one rule have multiple filter conditions?

A rule can only add one group of filter conditions, but within the filter conditions, you can add multiple `key:value` matching filter rules. Therefore, just click the input field to add multiple conditions, and after adding, click the input field to view the rules.

:material-chat-question: Label: When creating a new monitor, I added the `{df_label}` variable in the event content, but the final event record generated by the monitor has an empty value for this `df_label` tag.

The `df_label` in the event > content details > extended fields is a system field. When the variable added in the monitor > event content conflicts with this system field, it will be discarded, and only the `df_label` field under the event will be displayed.
