# Official Monitoring Templates Library
---

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> includes various ready-to-use monitoring templates, supporting one-click creation of monitors for hosts, Docker, Elasticsearch, Redis, Alibaba Cloud RDS, Alibaba Cloud SLB, Flink, and dozens of other services through the **+ Create from Template** option. After successfully creating a template, the corresponding official monitor is automatically added to the current workspace.

**Note**: Before creating a template, you need to [install DataKit](../../datakit/datakit-install.md) on the host and enable the relevant collectors; otherwise, the monitor will not generate alert events.

## Create a Template {#create}

In **Monitors**, select **+ Create from Template** to add the specified official monitoring template to the current space.

You can choose to create any single template or create multiple templates in bulk. A wide variety of monitoring templates are available, requiring no manual configuration and are ready-to-use out-of-the-box.

On the **+ Create from Template** page, <u>the left side lists all template types, while the right side shows all detection rules under each template type</u>. You can perform the following actions:

- In the **Template Library** on the left, check specific libraries to filter templates;
- You can paginate through all detection rules and use the üîç search bar to search by name in real-time;
- Select multiple detection rules on the right to create multiple monitors in bulk. After successful creation, return to the monitors list. Clicking on a specific monitor allows you to edit the detection rules within that monitor, and saving changes will create a new monitor.

Please ensure you have installed DataKit on your host and configured the necessary collectors before creating templates, as this is essential for generating alerts.
