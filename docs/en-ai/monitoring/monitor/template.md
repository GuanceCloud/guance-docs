# Official Monitoring Templates Library
---

Guance provides a variety of ready-to-use monitoring templates, supporting one-click creation of monitoring for hosts, Docker, Elasticsearch, Redis, Alibaba Cloud RDS, Alibaba Cloud SLB, Flink, and dozens of other services through **+ Create from Template**. After successfully creating a template, the corresponding official monitors are automatically added to the current workspace.

**Note**: Before creating a template, you need to [install DataKit](../../datakit/datakit-install.md) on the host and enable the relevant collectors; otherwise, the monitors associated with the template will not generate alert events.

## Creating Templates {#create}

In **Monitors**, select **+ Create from Template** to add specified official monitoring templates to the current space.

You can choose to create any individual template or create multiple templates in bulk. A wide range of monitoring templates are available without manual configuration, ready-to-use out-of-the-box.

On the **+ Create from Template** page, <u>the left side lists all template types, while the right side shows all detection rules under each template type</u>. You can perform the following actions:

- In the **Detection Library** on the left, check specific libraries to filter by type;
- You can browse detection rules page by page and use the üîç search bar to enter names for real-time searching;
- Select multiple detection rules on the right to batch-create multiple monitors. After successful creation, return to the monitor list. Click to open a specific monitor, and you can edit the detection rules within that monitor. Saving changes is equivalent to creating a new monitor.
