# External Event Detection

External event detection is used to receive anomaly records generated by third-party systems and create related events. By using the standard Webhook URL in the detection rules, corresponding monitoring event data, alerting strategies, and visualization dashboards are generated within Guance.

## Application Scenarios

Anomaly events or records generated by third-party systems are sent to an HTTP server via a specified URL using a POST request, which then generates event data within Guance.

## Default Configuration

1. **Monitor Name**: Supports custom names

2. **Webhook URL**: A Webhook URL is generated by default when entering the creation page, and you can customize additional parameters to mark the purpose of the address.

External event data is proactively reported by third-party systems to the Guance center, providing necessary event data. Only events that detect and match corresponding fields can generate anomalies and trigger alerts.

The required fields are shown in the following example: The five major fields under `event` must be included to successfully match with Guance; `extraData` is for custom-added fields:

```
{
    "event": {
        "status": "warning",
        "title": "External Event Monitor Test 1",
        "message": "Hello, this is the message from the external event monitor",
        "dimension_tags": {"heros": "caiwenji"},
        "check_value": 20
    },
    "extraData": {
        "name": "xxxxxxxx"
    }
}
```
