# Definition of Levels {#definition}

Guance has configured four default level options for Incident: P0, P1, P2, and Unknown.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | Default level configuration, critical business functionality is unavailable and widely affects users. |
| P1 | Default level configuration, critical business functionality is unavailable but impacts a limited number of users, such as internal users only. |
| P2 | Default level configuration, peripheral business functionality is unavailable, and prolonged failure will significantly impact user experience. |
| Unknown | Default level configuration, business impact is unknown. |

In addition to the default levels, you can configure custom levels to meet various needs.

Click **Add Level**, select the level color block, enter the level name and description, and creation will be successful.

For levels, you can perform the following operations:

1. Edit: Click the edit button to modify the current custom level's color, name, and description.
2. Delete: Click to delete the current level.

**Note**: You can add up to 10 levels.

## Enable/Disable Default Configuration

- Enable: If the default configuration is enabled and there are new custom levels in the current workspace, you can choose both default and custom levels when creating or modifying an Incident;
- Disable: If the default configuration is disabled, you can only choose custom level configurations when creating/modifying an Incident.

???+ warning "Disabling this option requires attention to three points:"

    - There must already be custom levels to ensure that there are selectable levels when creating/modifying an Issue;
    - In cases where abnormal events are generated by monitors, intelligent monitoring, or automatic Issue discovery and synchronized to create Incident tracking, the Issue level will be left blank;
    - If Issues using default levels still exist within the workspace, their levels will be set to blank.


## Platform-Level Level Configuration Impact {#backstage}

![](../img/issue-backstage.png)

1. Guance supports [managing Incident level configurations at the platform level](../../deployment/setting.md#global-settings). Once global configuration is enabled, the Incident level configurations at the workspace level will no longer apply.
2. After enabling global levels, if other level configurations are applied in rules such as monitors, intelligent monitoring, or Issue auto-discovery within the workspace, newly created Issues will have their levels set to blank.
