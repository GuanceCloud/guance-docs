# Log Blacklist
---

Guance provides comprehensive log collection capabilities, supporting the collection of log data generated by Windows/Linux/MacOS hosts, web servers, virtual machines, network devices, security devices, databases, etc. However, since the collected logs may contain parts that you do not need, Guance offers the **Log Blacklist** feature, which allows you to **add log filtering rules to filter and prevent logs that match these rules from being reported to the workspace**, helping you save on log storage costs.

## Prerequisites

You need to first create a [Guance account](https://www.guance.com), and then [install DataKit](../../datakit/datakit-install.md) on your host to enable the relevant integrations for data collection.

## Purpose of the Log Blacklist

### 1. Cost Savings

In Guance, the billing method for log data is as follows:

| **Billing Item** | **Unit** | **Commercial Plan Pricing** |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Retention Policy |  | 7 Days | 14 Days | 30 Days | 60 Days |
| Number of Log Entries | Per Million Logs | 1.2 CNY | 1.5 CNY | 2 CNY | 2.5 CNY |

For example, consider the logs generated by **Synthetic Tests**. If we create a node in Beijing that performs a Synthetic Test on our company's website every minute, a log entry will be uploaded to the workspace each minute. However, we are more interested in cases where the Synthetic Test times out or fails. Therefore, using the log blacklist feature, we can filter out logs with `status` set to `OK`, significantly reducing data costs.

### 2. Peace of Mind

Log blacklist configurations take effect immediately and apply to all users across the workspace. They only need to be configured once and remain effective permanently. Standard members and above can create and edit blacklist configurations.

### 3. Time Savings

Using the log blacklist feature reduces the collection of irrelevant logs, presenting more valuable information within the workspace, making it easier for you to find target logs quickly.

## How to Use the Log Blacklist Feature

### 1. View Blacklist

In the Guance workspace, click **Logs > Blacklist** to view all log filtering rules.

### 2. Create or Edit Blacklist Rules

- **Create**: Click **New Blacklist Rule** in the top-left corner of the log blacklist page to create a new log filtering rule.
- **Edit**: Click **Edit** on the right side of the log blacklist page to modify existing log filtering rules.

As shown in the following image, select the log source `http_dial_testing`, and filter out logs where `status=OK` and `city=hangzhou`. Logs that meet these filtering conditions will not be reported to the workspace.

### 3. Delete Blacklist Rules

Click **Delete** on the right side of the log blacklist page to remove existing log filtering rules. After deletion, log data will be reported to the workspace as usual.
