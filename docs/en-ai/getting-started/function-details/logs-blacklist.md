# Log Blacklist
---

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> provides comprehensive log collection capabilities, supporting the collection of log data generated by Windows/Linux/MacOS hosts, web servers, virtual machines, network devices, security devices, databases, etc. However, since collected logs may contain parts that you do not need, <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> offers the **Log Blacklist** feature, which <u>filters out log data that matches the specified rules and prevents it from being reported to the workspace</u>, helping you save on log storage costs.

## Prerequisites

You need to first create a [<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> account](https://www.guance.com), and then [install DataKit](../../datakit/datakit-install.md) on your host to enable the relevant integrations for data collection.

## Purpose of the Log Blacklist

### 1. Cost Savings

In <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, the billing method for log data is as follows:

| **Billing Item** | **Billing Unit** | **Commercial Plan Tiered Pricing** |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Storage Policy |  | 7 Days | 14 Days | 30 Days | 60 Days |
| Number of Log Entries | Per Million Logs | $0.18 | $0.22 | $0.30 | $0.37 |

For example, consider logs generated by **Synthetic Tests**. If we create a node in Beijing that tests our company's website every minute, a log entry will be generated each minute and uploaded to the workspace. However, we are more concerned with cases where the test times out or fails. In this case, using the log blacklist feature to filter out logs with `status` as `OK` can significantly reduce data costs.

### 2. Peace of Mind

The log blacklist configuration takes effect immediately and applies to all users within the workspace. It only needs to be configured once and remains effective indefinitely. Standard members and above can create and edit blacklist configurations.

### 3. Time Saving

Using the log blacklist function reduces the collection of invalid logs, presenting more useful information within the workspace, making it easier for you to quickly find target logs.

## How to Use the Log Blacklist Function

### 1. View Blacklist

In the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> workspace, click **Logs > Blacklist** to view all log filtering rules.

- **Create**: In the upper-left corner of the log blacklist page, click **Create Blacklist** to create a new log filtering rule.
- **Edit**: On the right side of the log blacklist page, click **Edit** to modify an existing log filtering rule.

As shown below, select the log source `http_dial_testing`, and filter logs where `status=OK` and `city=hangzhou`. Logs that match these filtering criteria will not be reported to the workspace.
