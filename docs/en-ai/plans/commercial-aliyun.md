On the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> side, if the current Alibaba Cloud account ID is not linked to a <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Center account, two scenarios may occur:

:material-numeric-1-circle-outline: [No Billing Center Account](#register): You need to register a <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> account and a Billing Center account to achieve cloud account binding and settlement;

:material-numeric-2-circle-outline: [Has Billing Center Account](#bond): You can directly bind the Billing Center account to achieve cloud account settlement.
