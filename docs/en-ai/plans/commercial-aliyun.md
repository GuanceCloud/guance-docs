On the Guance side, if your current Alibaba Cloud account ID is not linked to a Guance billing center account, two scenarios may occur:

:material-numeric-1-circle-outline: [No Billing Center Account](#register): You need to register for a Guance account and a billing center account, then link the cloud account for billing;

:material-numeric-2-circle-outline: [Has Billing Center Account](#bond): You can directly bind the billing center account to enable cloud account billing.

If the current billing center account does not yet have any associated workspaces, you need to create one first. Since the Guance console and billing center are two separate platforms, you need to confirm whether you have registered for Guance and have a Guance account.
