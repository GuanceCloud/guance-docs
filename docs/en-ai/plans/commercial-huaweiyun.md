If not linked to the Guance fee center account, you will be redirected to the following page:

:material-numeric-1-circle-outline: [No Fee Center Account](#register): Register a Guance account and fee center account, then bind for billing purposes;

:material-numeric-2-circle-outline: [Existing Fee Center Account](#bond): Directly bind the existing fee center account for billing.

    A fee center account is an independent account within the Guance fee center platform used for managing Commercial Plan billing. It allows a single account to associate multiple workspaces for consolidated billing management.
