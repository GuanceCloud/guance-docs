# Getting Started with Guance


![](img/background.png)


## How is the Traffic Generated in Workspaces Billed?

When various services are invoked within a workspace, corresponding traffic data is generated. The billing process involves two procedures:

:material-numeric-1-circle: Track the scale of data volume generated by the workspace.  
:material-numeric-2-circle: Generate detailed invoices based on actual traffic.

Traffic data generated in the workspace **is stored separately by workspace and synchronized to the billing center to generate invoices**.

Therefore, these two procedures operate independently within the workspace and the billing center, achieving cost synchronization through association with the billing center account ID.

## Two Essential Accounts for Billing


:material-numeric-1-circle: Guance Console Account: Bound to workspaces, it tracks the data volume access scale and invoice details under this account; it can be synchronized to a specified billing center account.

:material-numeric-2-circle: Guance Billing Center Account: Can be bound to one or multiple workspaces to achieve unified cost management.

**Note**: Workspaces can be billed individually or multiple workspaces can be bound together for joint billing.

### Why Are Two Accounts Needed?

The billing process mainly includes two aspects. On one hand, workspaces are created under the Guance console account, where data traffic is stored and tracked. On the other hand, the billing center account is bound to the workspace to obtain the invoice data for the corresponding workspace, and finally, the bill is settled according to the user's chosen method.

## What Billing Methods Does Guance Support?


:material-numeric-1-circle: Enter the [Billing Center](https://boss.guance.com/) and use the billing center account directly for settlement. You only need to recharge or purchase prepaid cards in the billing center account to complete the invoice payment.

:material-numeric-2-circle: Supports cloud vendor accounts for settlement, currently supporting four major cloud platforms: Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure.

## FAQs

:material-chat-question: What is the Difference Between Activating Guance Service via the Official Website and Cloud Vendors?

Both channels can successfully activate Guance services, but the main difference lies in the **billing method options after activation**.

- When activating via the Guance official website, you can choose either the Guance billing center or a cloud vendor account for settlement.
- When activating via a specific cloud vendor, you can only settle using that cloud vendorâ€™s account.

Therefore, if you have a preferred billing method, you can choose the activation channel based on your billing preference.


:material-chat-question: How to Bind the Billing Center Account with Workspaces?

- If you are a new registrant, during the registration process on the Guance official website, you will simultaneously create a Guance console account, a billing center account, and a workspace, which will automatically be bound together.

- If you are settling through a cloud vendor channel, after successfully subscribing to Guance services via the cloud vendor, there will be a workflow to bind the workspace, allowing you to choose the available workspaces as needed.


:material-chat-question: Why Are Two Accounts Needed?

Workspaces are created under the console account, while multiple workspaces can be combined for billing purposes. Since these two processes are handled separately, two accounts are required for management.

                                        
:material-chat-question: How to Confirm Whether You Have a Guance Console Account and a Billing Center Account?

The Guance console account is used for logging into the official website: https://www.guance.com. **The unique identifier for the account is the email address**.

The billing center account can be viewed under **Guance Workspace > Paid Plans & Invoices**. If you have a billing center account, the settlement account will display normally; alternatively, you can log in directly to the billing center platform: https://boss.guance.com. **The unique identifier for the billing center account is the username**.
