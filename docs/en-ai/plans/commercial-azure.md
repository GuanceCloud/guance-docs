## Activate the Guance Commercial Plan

After clicking, you will be automatically redirected to the activation page of Guance. If your current Microsoft Cloud account is not linked to a Guance billing center account, two scenarios may occur:

:material-numeric-1-circle-outline: [No billing center account](#register): You need to register for a Guance account and a billing center account before linking the cloud account for billing;

:material-numeric-2-circle-outline: [Existing billing center account](#bond): You can directly bind the billing center account to enable cloud account billing.

### Existing Billing Center Account {#bond}

If you already have a billing center account, click next, and you will be directed to the binding page:

**Note**: The site selection in the top-right corner of this page is unrelated to the billing center binding process and only affects the site when creating a workspace later. This selection cannot be changed afterward.

Since the Guance console and the billing center are two separate platforms, you need to confirm whether you have registered for Guance and have a Guance account.
