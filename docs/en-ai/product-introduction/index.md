## Observability

In the cloud-native era, enterprises adopt deployment methods such as microservices, containers, and Serverless to follow changes in IT architecture and cloud-native technology practices. Simultaneously, they need to integrate perspectives from development and business departments while possessing broader and more proactive capabilities than traditional monitoring. This has led to traditional monitoring technologies and tools being unable to meet the requirements of complex IT systems in terms of controllability and stability.

In 2018, CNCF introduced the term <font color="coral">**"Observability"**</font> into the IT field, stating that observability is a capability that must be possessed in the cloud-native era. Since then, "observability" has become one of the hottest topics in the cloud-native technology domain. Subsequently, CNCF published the [Observability Whitepaper](https://github.com/cncf/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper.md)
([:material-hand-pointing-right: Chinese Translation](https://github.com/chenmudu/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper-zh.md)), which provides a detailed introduction. It mentions the "three pillars of observability," namely Metrics, Logs, and Traces, which have become common knowledge in the IT field.


## Guance

Based on the prediction and firm belief in IT observability, our company started building <font color="coral">**"the cloud-era system observability platform — Guance"**</font> as early as 2018. After five years of meticulous refinement by a professional team, Guance was officially launched on April 28, 2022.<br/>
After entering the market, Guance continues to maintain its long-standing <font color="coral">**[“bi-weekly iteration”](../release-notes/index.md)**</font> update frequency, actively collecting feedback from different types of users, expanding coverage across various technology stacks, optimizing user experience in product usage details, and enhancing the robust stability of public and private platforms.

As a unified real-time monitoring application with observability, [Guance](https://www.guance.com/) helps users quickly achieve system observability, uniformly meeting monitoring needs related to cloud platforms, cloud-native environments, applications, and businesses, building <u>end-to-end observability</u> for every complete application. Not only does Guance aim to provide observability based on the "three pillars of observability"; it also aims to help enterprises pursue observability in "testing, staging, and production environments." Furthermore, it effectively connects "development, testing, and operations teams" within the entire enterprise architecture, achieving <u>observability throughout the software development lifecycle</u>.


## Core Modules

Guance, as a platform for end-to-end observability of application systems, can also be understood as a **powerful data analysis platform**. Corresponding to the flow of observability data, several core modules of Guance run through this process.
