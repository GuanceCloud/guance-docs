# Customer Value
---

Using Guance will provide users with the following value improvements compared to open-source products:

| <div style="width: 200px">Use Case</div> | Self-built Open Source | Guance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Building a Cloud-era Monitoring System** | Requires at least 3 months of investment from a professional technical team, and that's just the beginning | Ready-to-use in 30 minutes |
| **Cost Investment** | Even a simple open-source monitoring product requires hardware investment exceeding $20,000/year. For an observability platform in the cloud era, it would be at least $100,000/year fixed investment (estimated on cloud hardware) | Pay-as-you-go, fees are elastic based on actual business conditions, overall costs are more than 50% lower than the comprehensive investment in using open-source products. |
| **System Maintenance Management** | Requires long-term attention and investment from professional engineers; mixed use of various open-source products also increases management complexity | No need to worry, focus on business issues |
| **Number of Probes Needed on Servers** | Each open-source software requires a separate probe, consuming significant server performance | One probe, fully binary-based, with minimal CPU and memory usage |
| **Value Delivered** | Depends solely on the capabilities of the company's own engineers and their proficiency with open-source products | Comprehensive data-driven platform, full observability, enabling engineers to solve problems using data |
| **Root Cause Analysis for Performance and Failures** | Relies entirely on the team's own capabilities | Quickly identifies root causes based on data analysis |
| **Security** | Various mixed open-source software challenges the comprehensive skills of technical engineers | Comprehensive security scanning and testing, customer-side code is open-sourced, and the product is updated promptly to ensure security |
| **Scalability and Services** | Requires building an SRE engineer team in-house | Provides professional services equivalent to having an external SRE support team configured |
| **Training and Support** | Hiring external trainers | Long-term online training support |

From the table above, it can be seen that ensuring the overall stability and reliability of a system can involve substantial investment, not just the cost of the software itself.

While open-source software typically appears to require no monetary expense, the investments in cloud services or physical servers, time, and potential repeated investments due to changes in the technical team must also be considered.

Therefore, a team should adopt a more efficient approach to support its business development rather than investing large resources in non-core areas. Professional matters should be handled by professional services.

In fact, a team's investment in system assurance often exceeds 30% to 50% of the total system construction and maintenance costs. This includes server resources consumed by various open-source probes, server investments required for deploying open-source software, and the corresponding maintenance and monitoring system investments. Additionally, developers, testers, and operations engineers spend considerable effort determining various failures and anomalies, **consuming a lot of working hours**. This does not include business losses caused by system failures due to lack of observability, which are all **hidden costs**. Teams that do not use powerful observability platforms often face significant hidden costs and wasted time.

<font color=coral>**Choosing Guance means the technical team gains a very powerful observability product, significantly saving both explicit and hidden costs associated with system assurance, helping each team focus on their core business**.</font>
