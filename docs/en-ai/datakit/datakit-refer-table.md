# Reference Table

Through the Reference Table feature, Pipeline supports importing external data for data processing.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
???+ attention

    This feature consumes a relatively high amount of memory. For example, approximately 200MB of disk space (JSON file) is used for 1.5 million rows of non-repeating data (two string columns; one each of int, float, and bool). The memory usage stays around 950MB to 1.2GB, with peak memory usage during updates ranging from 2.2GB to 2.7GB. You can configure `use_sqlite = true` to save the data on disk.

## Table Structure and Column Data Types {#table-struct}

The table structure is a two-dimensional table, distinguished by table names. There must be at least one column, and all elements within each column must have consistent data types, which must be one of int(int64), float(float64), string, or bool.

Setting primary keys for tables is not currently supported, but queries can be made through any column, and the first row of all results found will be returned as the query result. Below is an example of a table structure:

- Table name: `refer_table_abc`

- Column names (col1, col2, ...), column data types (int, float, ...), and row data:

| col1: int | col2: float | col3: string | col4: bool |
| ---       | ---         | ---          | ---        |
| 1         | 1.1         | "abc"        | true       |
| 2         | 3           | "def"        | false      |

## Importing Data from External Sources {#import}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Host Installation"

    Configure the reference table URL and pull interval (default interval is 5 minutes) in the configuration file `datakit.conf`
    
    ```toml
    [pipeline]
      refer_table_url = "http[s]://host:port/path/to/resource"
      refer_table_pull_interval = "5m"
      use_sqlite = false
      sqlite_mem_mode = false
    ```

=== "Kubernetes"

    Currently, the Content-Type of the HTTP response from the address specified by `refer_table_url` must be `Content-Type: application/json`.

- Data consists of multiple tables represented as a list, where each table is a map. The fields in the map are:

| Field Name   | Description     | Data Type     |
| ---          | ---             | ---           |
| table_name   | Table name      | string        |
| column_name  | All column names| [ ]string     |
| column_type  | Column data type, corresponding to column names, with values being "int", "float", "string", or "bool" | [ ]string |
| row_data     | Multiple row data, where int, float, and bool types can be represented by their respective types or as strings; elements in []any must correspond to column names and column types | [ ][ ]any  |

- JSON structure:
  
```json
[
    {
        "table_name":  string,
        "column_name": []string{},
        "column_type": []string{},
        "row_data": [
            []any{},
            ...
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```

- Example:

```json
[
    {
        "table_name": "table_abc",
        "column_name": ["col", "col2", "col3", "col4"],
        "column_type": ["string", "float", "int", "bool"],
        "row_data": [
            ["a", 123, "123", "false"],
            ["ab", "1234.", "123", true],
            ["ab", "1234.", "1235", "false"]
        ]
    },
    {
        "table_name": "table_ijk",
        "column_name": ["name", "id"],
        "column_type": ["string", "string"],
        "row_data": [
            ["a", "12"],
            ["a", "123"],
            ["ab", "1234"]
        ]
    }
]
```

## Using SQLite to Save Imported Data {#sqlite}

To save imported data into an SQLite database, simply set `use_sqlite` to `true`:

```toml
[pipeline]
    refer_table_url = "http[s]://host:port/path/to/resource"
    refer_table_pull_interval = "5m"
    use_sqlite = true
    sqlite_mem_mode = false
```

When using SQLite to save data, if the above `sqlite_mem_mode` is set to `true`, it will use SQLite's in-memory mode; by default, it uses SQLite's disk mode.

## Practical Examples {#example}

Write the JSON text above into a file named `test.json`, and place it under */var/www/html* after installing NGINX via `apt` on Ubuntu18.04+

Run `curl -v localhost/test.json` to test whether the file can be retrieved via HTTP GET. The output should look like this:

```txt
...
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 522
< Last-Modified: Tue, 16 Aug 2022 06:20:52 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< ETag: "62fb3744-20a"
< Accept-Ranges: bytes
< 
[
    {
        "table_name": "table_abc",
        "column_name": ["col", "col2", "col3", "col4"],
        "column_type": ["string", "float", "int", "bool"],
        "row_data": [
...
```

Modify the value of `refer_table_url` in the configuration file `datakit.conf` to:

```toml
[pipeline]
  refer_table_url = "http://localhost/test.json"
  refer_table_pull_interval = "5m"
  use_sqlite = false
  sqlite_mem_mode = false
```

Navigate to the Datakit *pipeline/logging* directory and create a test script `refer_table_for_test.p`, writing the following content into it:

```python
# Extract table name, column name, and column value from input
json(_, table)
json(_, key)
json(_, value)

# Query and append the current column data, defaulting to adding it as a field to the data
query_refer_table(table, key, value)
```

```shell
cd /usr/local/datakit/pipeline/logging

vim refer_table_for_test.p

datakit pipeline -P refer_table_for_test.p -T '{"table": "table_abc", "key": "col2", "value": 1234.0}' --date
```

From the following output, it can be seen that the columns col, col2, col3, and col4 were successfully appended to the output result:

```shell
2022-08-16T15:02:14.150+0800  DEBUG  refer-table  refertable/cli.go:26  performing request[method GET url http://localhost/test.json]
{
  "col": "ab",
  "col2": 1234,
  "col3": 123,
  "col4": true,
  "key": "col2",
  "message": "{\"table\": \"table_abc\", \"key\": \"col2\", \"value\": 1234.0}",
  "status": "unknown",
  "table": "table_abc",
  "time": "2022-08-16T15:02:14.158452592+08:00",
  "value": 1234
}
```
