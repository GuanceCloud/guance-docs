## 前置条件

- SQL Server 版本 >= 2019

- 创建用户：

Linux、Windows:

```
USE master;
GO
CREATE LOGIN [guance] WITH PASSWORD = N'yourpassword';
GO
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [guance];
GO
GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [guance];
GO
```

aliyun RDS SQL Server:

```
USE master;
GO
CREATE LOGIN [guance] WITH PASSWORD = N'yourpassword';
GO

```

## 安装配置

### 指标采集 (必选)

1. 开启 Datakit SQLServer 插件，复制 sample 文件

进入 DataKit 安装目录下的 `conf.d/db` 目录，复制 `sqlserver.conf.sample` 并命名为 `sqlserver.conf`。示例如下：

```toml

[[inputs.sqlserver]]
  ## your sqlserver host ,example ip:port
  host = ""

  ## your sqlserver user,password
	## We recommend **use simple password** here, only use [a-zA-Z_0-9], do not
	## use special characters, such as #, @, $, theses characters may cause
	## error on parsing sqlserver connection string.
  user = ""
  password = ""

  ## (optional) collection interval, default is 10s
  interval = "10s"

  # [inputs.sqlserver.log]
  # files = []
  # #grok pipeline script path
  # pipeline = "sqlserver.p"

  [inputs.sqlserver.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"

```

2. 修改 sqlserver.conf 配置文件

参数说明

- host：服务连接地址
- user：用户名
- password：密码
- interval：数据采集频率
```
[[inputs.sqlserver]]
  host = "host"
  user = "user"
  password = "password"
  interval = "10s"
```

3. 重启 Datakit (如果需要开启日志，请配置日志采集再重启)
```
services.msc 找到 datakit 重新启动
```

### 日志采集

如需采集 SQL Server 的日志，可在 sqlserver.conf 中 将 `files` 打开，并写入 SQL Server 日志文件的绝对路径。比如：

```toml
    [[inputs.sqlserver]]
      ...
      [inputs.sqlserver.log]
        files = ["/var/opt/mssql/log/error.log"]
```

参数说明

- files：日志文件路径 (通常填写访问日志和错误日志)
- pipeline：日志切割文件(内置)，实际文件路径 /usr/local/datakit/pipeline/sqlserver.p 

开启日志采集以后，默认会产生日志来源（`source`）为 `sqlserver` 的日志。

>注意：必须将 DataKit 安装在 SQL Server 所在主机才能采集 SQL Server 日志

#### 日志 pipeline 功能切割字段说明

- SQL Server 通用日志切割 

通用日志文本示例：
```
2021-05-28 10:46:07.78 spid10s     0 transactions rolled back in database 'msdb' (4:0). This is an informational message only. No user action is required
```

切割后的字段列表如下：

| 字段名 | 字段值              | 说明                                         |
| ---    | ---                 | ---                                          |
| msg    | spid...             | 日志内容                                     |
| time   | 1622169967780000000 | 纳秒时间戳（作为行协议时间）                 |
| origin | spid10s             | 源                                           |
| status | info                | 由于日志没有明确字段说明日志等级，默认为info |
