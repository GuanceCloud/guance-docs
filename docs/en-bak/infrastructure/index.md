## Overview

Guance supports collecting data from host, container, process, network, and other custom infrastructure, and reporting it to the workspace. On the **Infrastructure** page, you can view the data of all infrastructure types through the categorized list of infrastructures.

For example, if you view the CPU, memory and other metric data of Host A, you can view the relevant data in the [Host](./host.md) category; To view the CPU data of container B, you can view the related data in the [Container](./container.md) category.
