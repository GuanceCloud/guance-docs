# Logs
---

## Overview 

Logs are text data generated by programs that follow a certain format (usually including timestamps). Usually, logs are generated by the server and output to different files, such as system logs, application logs, security logs and so on. These logs are distributed and stored on different servers. When the system fails, we need to log on to each server to find the cause of the failure in the logs, which causes great trouble for us to troubleshoot. 

Therefore, if these logs can be managed centrally and provided with centralized retrieval function and correlation analysis, it can not only provide high diagnosis efficiency, but also have a comprehensive understanding of the system situation, which can avoid the passivity of fire fighting afterwards. 

<!--
Log data plays a very important role in the following aspects: 

- Data search: We can retrieving log information and locate corresponding problems and then find solutions; 
- Service diagnosis: through the log information statistics, analysis, understand the server load and service running status;
- Data analysis: support for further data analysis. 
-->

Guance provides comprehensive log collection capability. By configuring [log collection](collection.md), the log data can be uniformly reported to the guance workspace, and you can store, audit, monitor, alarm, analyze and export the collected log data uniformly.
