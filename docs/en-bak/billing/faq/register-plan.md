## How can AWS users activate Guance?

## What is the difference between the Commercial Plan of Guance and the Exclusive Plan? Can they be switched?

They cannot be switched. The commercial plan of Guance uses the default ES storage method, while the exclusive plan uses the SLS storage method.

> For more details, see [Data Storage Options](../../billing/billing-method/data-storage.md#options).

**Note**: Only the exclusive plan with SLS storage can be activated by purchasing through the Alibaba Cloud Marketplace. Workspaces that have already activated the default storage do not support switching to SLS storage.

> For more details, see [Purchasing the Exclusive Plan of Guance in the Alibaba Cloud Marketplace](../../plans/commercial-aliyun-sls.md).

## Why Is the workspace locked?

If you choose to settle with an Alibaba Cloud account and it is released, expired, or deleted, the originally related settled workspace will be automatically locked. Guance will send out relevant email notifications; the same applies to AWS and Huawei Cloud accounts.

## How to restore a locked workspace?

If your workspace is locked, please contact your account manager. All subsequent unlocking operations will be conducted by Guance.

## How to get online support if the above FAQs do not solve the problem?

Guance provides online ticket support, which can be accessed [here](../../billing-center/support-center.md).
