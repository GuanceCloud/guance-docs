## What Is the difference between Guance Billing Center account settlement and cloud account settlement?

- [Guance Billing Center Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/enterprise-account.md): Settle directly in the Guance Billing Center by recharging, which you can do through cash recharge, purchasing vouchers, or prepaid cards for the Guance Billing Center account;
- [Cloud Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aliyun-account.md): Settle directly through the corresponding cloud vendor's account.

## What Is arbitrary account settlement?

Arbitrary account settlement means that when you **change the settlement method** in the Guance Billing Center, you are not restricted by the registration site and can choose any cloud account for settlement. For example, if you register an account at the "CN1 (Hangzhou)" site, the default settlement method is **Alibaba Cloud account settlement**. However, if you have enabled arbitrary account settlement, you can choose "Amazon Cloud account settlement."

To enable this, please contact your account manager.
