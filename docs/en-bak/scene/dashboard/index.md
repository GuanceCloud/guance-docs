# Dashboard


**Dashboards** consolidate visualization reports on a single interface, enabling data insights through comprehensive analysis. You can craft custom visualizations by starting with a blank canvas or importing templates, and track metrics across various data sources using charts, time widgets, search filters, and tags.

## Create

You can create a dashboard in three ways:

:material-numeric-1-circle: Directly create a [Blank Dashboard](#blank);

:material-numeric-2-circle: Import a [Custom Template](#custom);

:material-numeric-3-circle: Choose a view from the [Inner Template Library](#view).

### Blank Dashboard {#blank}

![](../img/8.dashboard_1.png)

1. Define the name of the current dashboard;
2. Enter a description for the dashboard as needed;
3. Select [Tags](../../management/global-label.md) for later group management;
4. Choose the [Visibility Range](#range) for the current dashboard;
5. Click Confirm.

#### Visibility Range {#range}

The visibility range of the dashboard includes:

- Public: Dashboards open to all members of the workspace.
    - To restrict visibility among members, click to select permission targets.    
- Private: Non-public dashboards visible only to the creator; other members (including Owner) have no view permissions.    

**Note**:

1. Non-public dashboards shared by link are invisible to non-creators.
2. The public/private switch affects only the current dashboard's visibility, not other settings.


### Custom Template {#custom}
