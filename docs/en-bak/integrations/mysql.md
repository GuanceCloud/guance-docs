MySQL metrics collection, which collects the following data:

- MySQL global status basic data collection
- Schema related data
- InnoDB related metrics
- Support custom query data collection

## Configuration {#config}

### Preconditions {#requirements}

- MySQL version 5.7+
- Create a monitoring account (in general, you need to log in with MySQL `root` account to create MySQL users)

```sql
CREATE USER 'datakit'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<UNIQUEPASSWORD>';

-- MySQL 8.0+ create the datakit user with the caching_sha2_password method
CREATE USER 'datakit'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password by '<UNIQUEPASSWORD>';
```

- Authorization

```sql
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'datakit'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'datakit'@'localhost';
show databases like 'performance_schema';
GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO 'datakit'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'datakit'@'localhost';
GRANT replication client on *.*  to 'datakit'@'localhost';
```
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
???+ attention

    - All the above creation and authorization operations limit that the user `datakit` can only access MySQL on MySQL host (`localhost`). If MySQL is collected remotely, it is recommended to replace `localhost` with `%` (indicating that DataKit can access MySQL on any machine), or use a specific DataKit installation machine address.

    - Note that if you find the collector has the following error when using `localhost` , you need to replace the above `localhost` with `::1`<br/>
    `Error 1045: Access denied for user 'datakit'@'localhost' (using password: YES)`

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Host Installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/db` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `mysql.conf.sample` and name it `mysql.conf`. Examples are as follows:

    ```
    
    Once configured, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    The collector can now be turned on by [ConfigMap Injection Collector Configuration](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).

### Binlog Start {#binlog}

MySQL Binlog is not turned on. If you want to count the Binlog size, you need to turn on the Binlog function corresponding to MySQL:

```sql
-- ON: turn on, OFF: turn off
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
```

Binlog starts, see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40682381/how-do-i-enable-mysql-binary-logging){:target="_blank"} or [this answer](https://serverfault.com/questions/706699/enable-binlog-in-mysql-on-ubuntu){:target="_blank"}.

### Database Performance Metrics Collection {#performance-schema}

The database performance metrics come from MySQL's built-in database `performance_schema`, which provides a way to get the internal performance of the server at runtime. Through this database, DataKit can collect statistics of various metrics of historical query statements, execution plans of query statements and other related performance metrics. The collected performance metric data is saved as a log, and the sources are `mysql_dbm_metric`, `mysql_dbm_sample` and `mysql_dbm_activity`.

To turn it on, you need to perform the following steps.

- Modify the configuration file and start monitoring and collection

```toml
[[inputs.mysql]]

# Turn on database performance metric collection
dbm = true

...

# Monitor metric configuration
[inputs.mysql.dbm_metric]
  enabled = true

# Monitor sampling configuration
[inputs.mysql.dbm_sample]
  enabled = true

# Waiting for event collection
[inputs.mysql.dbm_activity]
  enabled = true   
...

```

- MySQL Configuration

Modify the configuration file (such as `mysql.conf`), open the `MySQL Performance Schema`, and configure the parameters:

```toml
[mysqld]
performance_schema = on
max_digest_length = 4096
performance_schema_max_digest_length = 4096
performance_schema_max_sql_text_length = 4096
performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-current = on
performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-current = on
performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history-long = on
performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history = on

```

- Account configuration

Account authorization

```sql
-- MySQL 5.6 & 5.7
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO datakit@'%' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO datakit@'%';

-- MySQL >= 8.0
ALTER USER datakit@'%' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO datakit@'%';
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO datakit@'%';
```

Create a database

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS datakit;
GRANT EXECUTE ON datakit.* to datakit@'%';
GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON datakit.* TO datakit@'%';
```

Create the stored procedure `explain_statement` to get the SQL execution plan

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE datakit.explain_statement(IN query TEXT)
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
    SET @explain := CONCAT('EXPLAIN FORMAT=json ', query);
    PREPARE stmt FROM @explain;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
```

Create a separate stored procedure for the database that needs to collect execution plans (optional)

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE <db_name>.explain_statement(IN query TEXT)
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
    SET @explain := CONCAT('EXPLAIN FORMAT=json ', query);
    PREPARE stmt FROM @explain;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE <db_name>.explain_statement TO datakit@'%';
```

- `consumers` configuration

Method one (recommended): Dynamic configuration of `performance_schema.events_*` with `DataKit` requires the creation of the following stored procedure:

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE datakit.enable_events_statements_consumers()
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
    UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name LIKE 'events_statements_%';
    UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name = 'events_waits_current';
END $$
DELIMITER ;

GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE datakit.enable_events_statements_consumers TO datakit@'%';
```

Method 2: Manually configure `consumers`

```sql
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name LIKE 'events_statements_%';
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name = 'events_waits_current';
```

### Replication Metrics Collection {#replication_metrics}

To collect replication metrics `mysql_replication`, you need to start MySQL replication. `mysql_replication` metrics are collected from the replication database, so you can confirm that the MySQL replication environment is working properly by entering them in the slave database:

```sql
SHOW SLAVE STATUS;
```

If the `Slave_IO_Running` and `Slave_SQL_Running` fields are `Yes`, the replication environment is working properly.

To capture group replication metrics such as `count_transactions_in_queue`, you need to add the group_replication plugin to the list of plugins loaded by the server at startup (group_replication has been supported since MySQL version 5.7.17). In the configuration file `/etc/my.cnf` for the replication database, add the line:

```toml
plugin_load_add ='group_replication.so'
```

You can confirm that the group replication plugin is installed by `showing plugins;`.

To turn it on, you need to perform the following steps.

- Modify the configuration file and start monitoring and collection

```toml
  [[inputs.mysql]]

  ## Set replication to true to collect replication metrics
  replication = true
  ## Set group_replication to true to collect group replication metrics
  group_replication = true
  ...
  
```

## Metric {#metric}

For all of the following data collections, the global election tags will added automatically, we can add extra tags in `[inputs.mysql.tags]` if needed:

```toml
 [inputs.mysql.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```

### MySQL Run Log {#mysql-logging}

If you need to collect MySQL log, open the log-related configuration in the configuration. If you need to open MySQL slow query log, you need to open the slow query log. Execute the following statements in MySQL.

```sql
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';

-- Queries that do not use indexes are also considered a possible slow query
set global log_queries_not_using_indexes = 'ON';
```

```toml
[inputs.mysql.log]
    # Fill in the absolute path
    files = ["/var/log/mysql/*.log"]
```

> Note: When using log collection, you need to install the DataKit on the same host as the MySQL service, or use other methods to mount the log on the machine where the DataKit is located.

MySQL logs are divided into normal logs and slow logs.

### MySQL Normal Logs {#mysql-app-logging}

Original log:

``` log

```

The list of cut fields is as follows:

| Field Name   | Field Value                                                   | Description                         |

## FAQ {#faq}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
### :material-chat-question: Why the measurement `mysql_user_status` is not collected for Aliyun RDS? {#faq-user-no-data}

The measurement is collected from MySQL `performance_schema`. You should check if it is enabled by the SQL below：

```sql
show variables like "performance_schema";

+--------------------+-------+
| Variable_name      | Value |
+--------------------+-------+
| performance_schema | ON    |
+--------------------+-------+

```

If the value is `OFF`, please refer to the [document](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/41726.html?spm=a2c4g.276975.0.i9){:target="_blank"} to enable it.
