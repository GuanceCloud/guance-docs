# Intelligent Detection
---

Intelligent check is based on the intelligent check algorithm of Guance, which supports automatic check of infrastructure and application problems, helps users find problems occurring during the operation of IT systems, and quickly locates the causes of abnormal problems through root cause analysis; Through the intelligent prediction algorithm of Guance, users can foresee the potential problems of infrastructure and applications in advance, evaluate the impact level of problems on system operation, better determine the priority of troubleshooting work and reduce the uncertainty of troubleshooting process.

Intelligent check currently supports three check templates and custom check:

- [Memory leak](memory-leak.md): Detect whether the current workspace host has a memory leak problem
- [Disk usage](disk-usage.md): Detect whether the current workspace host's disk is overused
- [Application performance detection](apm.md): Detect whether there are fluctuations in the current workspace service QPS, average response time, P90 response time and error rate
- [Custom Check](../../developers/custom-bot-obs.md): Support custom check functions in DataFlux Func using the "Guance custom check core package" script package in the script market

## Operation Instructions

| **Operation**     | **Instructions**                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enable/Disable    | Guance supports enabling/disabling existing intelligent inspections. <br><li>Disabled: The check event will no longer be triggered;<br><li>Startup: Based on the startup time, the intelligent check will be restarted and related events will be triggered. |
| Export    | Guance supports "exporting JSON configuration". Export file name format: smart check name. json |
| Edit         | Guance supports re-editing the existing intelligent check, and the screening conditions and alarm policies of intelligent check can be re-edited by clicking the "Edit" button. |
| View Related Events | With the "View Related Events" action button, you can jump directly to the list of all events triggered by this intelligent check. For details, please refer to [event management](../../events/explorer.md).<br>Note: All smart patrol events that are triggered are status = error. |
