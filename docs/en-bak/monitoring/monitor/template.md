# Templates
---


Guance has built-in various ready-to-use monitoring templates, which support creating hosts, Docker, Elasticsearch, Redis, Alibaba Cloud RDS, Alibaba Cloud SLB, Flink monitoring, and dozens of other templates with one-click using the + New from Template option. Once the template is successfully created, the corresponding official monitors are automatically added to the current workspace.

**Note**: Before creating a template, you need to [install DataKit ](../datakit/datakit-install.md) on the host and enable the configuration of relevant collectors. Otherwise, the monitor corresponding to the template will not generate alert events.

## Create {#create}

In the **Monitor** section, select **Create from Template** to add a specific official monitoring template to the current space.

You can choose to create any template or create them in bulk. Currently, there are multiple monitoring templates available, which can be used out of the box without manual configuration.

On the creating page, the <u>left side shows all types of monitoring templates, and the right side shows all detection rules under each template type</u>. You can perform the following operations:

- In the left **Filter**, select specific monitors for corresponding filtering.
- You can paginate through all detection rules and use the search bar üîç to search by name in real time.
- Select multiple detection rules on the right side, and you can create multiple monitors in batch. After successful creation, you will return to the monitor list. After opening a specific monitor, you can edit the detection rules under the current monitor and save them, which is equivalent to creating a new monitor.
