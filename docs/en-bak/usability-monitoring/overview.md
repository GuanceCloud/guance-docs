## Introduction

In the Synthetic Tests Overview, you can analyze the application performance of the target object under the current dial-up task from two dimensions of geography and trend, including response time, round-trip time, connection time and usability rate.

- Response time: The time from the request end to the system response.
- Round trip time: The round trip time from the time when the requester sends the data packet to the time when the data packet is received.
- Connection time: The time from the request end to the time when the connection is established.
- Usability: Success rate of access on the requester.

## HTTP

In Synthetic Tests "Overview", select "HTTP", and through the "China"/"World" button in the upper left corner, you can view the request response time and usability rate in different regions, cities and countries.
