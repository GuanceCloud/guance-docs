# Android Application Analysis
---

## Overview

Application performance analysis can be viewed through the Guance console after application data has been collected to the Guance.

## Explorer Analysis

Guance provides Real User Monitoring explorer to help you view and analyze detailed information about user access to your applications. In "Real User Monitoring" , click on any application and then you can use "Explorer" to understand each user session, page performance, resources, long tasks, errors in action, the impact of latency on users, and help you fully understand and improve the operation status and usage of your application through search, filtering and correlation analysis to improve user experience. More details can be found in the documentation [Explorer](... /explorer/index.md).

## Scene Analysis

Guance provides visual Android application analysis with multiple built-in Android application monitoring solutions, including overview, performance analysis, resource analysis, and error analysis.

### Overview

The overview scenario of Android application counts the startup times, PV numbers, page error rate, page loading time, session analysis, performance analysis, error analysis and other metrics of Android access. From the aspects of Android application startup, session distribution, access to user equipment, popular page ranking, page visits ranking, resource error ranking, etc., visually display the data statistics of users accessing Android applications, quickly locate the problems of users accessing Android applications, and improve user access performance. Android applications that have been accessed can be viewed through environment and version filtering.
