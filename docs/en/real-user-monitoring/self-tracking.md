# Tracking

---

Guance supports you to create tracking tasks through **RUM** to monitor real-time custom link tracking trajectories. By pre-setting the link tracking trajectory, you can focus on filtering link data, accurately query user access experience, and discover vulnerabilities, anomalies, and risks in a timely manner.

## Precondition

The function currently **only supports Web, Android and iOS application integration**.

## Setup

Enter **RUM > Tracking > Create**.


1. Select one created application;
2. Enter the name of the current tracking task. *(Up to 64 characters; Mixed Chinese and English writing, underscores as separators are supported; Other special characters are not supported.)* 

Click **Create**, then you can see the cucceren tracking's configuration:

## Manage Tracking Tasks

After creating the tracking task, the task is started by default. You can view the performance data under the specified tracking ID in the Session explorer of the current application; you can also click the **Name** of the tracking to view the data generated by the tracking. At the same time, you can view or delete the tracking task.

## Automated Tracking {#auto-tracking}
