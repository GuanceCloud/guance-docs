# Long Task
---

You can view long tasks that block the main thread for more than 50ms while the user is using the application. This includes the page address and task duration.

In the Long Task Explorer, you can:

- Track each long task that users encounter, including the type of operation, operation name and duration.
- Analyze the performance of user interactions with the business application by combining associated resource requests, resource errors, logs and other data. This helps quickly identify and optimize code issues in the application.
