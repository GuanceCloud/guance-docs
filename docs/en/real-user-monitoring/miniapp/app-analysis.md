# Mini Program Application Analysis
---

## Introduction

After application data is collected in <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, you can view the APM analysis through the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console.

## Explorer Analysis

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> provides a RUM PV Explorer to help you view and analyze detailed information about user visits to your application. Within the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> workspace, open **User Analysis**, click on any application, and use the **Explorer** to understand each user session, page performance, resources, long tasks, errors in operations, delays affecting users, and more. This allows you to comprehensively understand and improve the operational status and usage of your application by searching, filtering, and correlating analyses, thereby enhancing user experience. For more details, refer to the documentation [Explorer](../explorer/index.md).

## Use Cases Analysis

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> offers visualized mini program application analysis with built-in monitoring solutions for various scenarios. You can view overviews, performance analysis, resource analysis, and error analysis under **User Analysis** - «Analysis Dashboard» - «Mini Program».

### Overview

The overview of mini program applications includes statistics on launch counts, PV numbers, page error rates, page load times, startup analysis, session analysis, performance analysis, and error analysis. It visually presents data on user visits to mini programs from aspects such as startup, session distribution, visiting user devices, popular page rankings, page visit volume rankings, and resource error rankings. This helps quickly identify issues with user visits to mini programs and improves user access performance. You can filter by environment and version to view connected mini programs.

### Performance Analysis

Performance analysis of mini program applications involves metrics like PV numbers, page load time, first render time, segment duration, most concerned page session counts, page long task analysis, and resource analysis. It provides real-time visualization of overall mini program page performance, allowing for precise identification of pages that need optimization. You can filter by environment and version to view connected mini programs.
