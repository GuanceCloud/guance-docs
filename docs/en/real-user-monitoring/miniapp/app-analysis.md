# Miniapp Application Analysis
---

## Overview

Application performance analysis can be viewed through the Guance Cloud console after application data has been collected to the Guance Cloud.

## Explorer Analysis

Guance Cloud provides Real User Monitoring explorer to help you view and analyze detailed information about user access to your applications. In "Real User Monitoring" , click on any application and then you can use "Explorer" to understand each user session, page performance, resources, long tasks, errors in action, the impact of latency on users, and help you fully understand and improve the operation status and usage of your application through search, filtering and correlation analysis to improve user experience. More details can be found in the documentation [Explorer](... /explorer/index.md).

## Scene Analysis

Guance Cloud provides visual Miniapp application analysis with multiple built-in Miniapp application monitoring solutions, including overview, performance analysis, resource analysis, and error analysis.

### Overview

The overview scenario of Miniapp application counts the startup times, PV numbers, page error rate, page loading time, session analysis, performance analysis, error analysis and other indicators of Miniapp access. From the aspects of Miniapp application startup, session distribution, access to user equipment, popular page ranking, page visits ranking, resource error ranking, etc., visually display the data statistics of users accessing Miniapp applications, quickly locate the problems of users accessing Miniapp applications, and improve user access performance. Miniapp applications that have been accessed can be viewed through environment and version filtering.
