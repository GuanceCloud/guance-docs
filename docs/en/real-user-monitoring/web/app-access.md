## Update Logs
2022.9.29

- The initialization parameter adds `isIntakeUrl` configuration, which is used to determine whether the data of the corresponding resource needs to be captured according to the requested resource url, and by default they are all captured. 

2022.3.10

-   New `traceType` configuration, configure the link tracing tool type, if not configure the default is `ddtrace`. Currently supports `ddtrace`, `zipkin`, `skywalking_v3`, `jaeger`, `zipkin_single_header`, `w3c_traceparent` 6 data types.
- New `allowedTracingOrigins` allows to inject a list of all requests with the header headers required by the trace collector. It can be the origin of the request, or it can be a regular.
- The original configuration item `allowedDDTracingOrigins` and the new configuration item `allowedTracingOrigins` are part of the same feature configuration. Either one can be configured, but if both are configured, `allowedTracingOrigins` is given more weight than `allowedDDTracingOrigins`.

2021.5.20 

-  In line with the V2 version indicator data changes, you need to upgrade the DataKit 1.1.7-rc0 onwards Refer to [DataKit Configuration](... /... /datakit/rum.md). 
- SDK upgrade V2, CDN address changed to `https://static.guance.com/browser-sdk/v2/dataflux-rum.js`.
- Removed `rum_web_page_performance`, `rum_web_resource_performance`, ` js_error`, `page` metrics data collection, added `view`, `action`, `long_task`, `error` metrics data collection.
- Initialize the new `trackInteractions` configuration to enable action (user behavior data) collection, and turn off the default state.

## Overview

Guance Cloud Real User Monitoring can analyze the performance of each Web application in a visual way by collecting the metrics data of each Web application.

## Precondition

- Installing DataKit ([DataKit Installation Documentation](... /... /datakit/datakit-install.md))

  
## Web Application Access

Login to Guance Cloud Console, enter "Real User Monitoring" page, click "New Application" in the upper right corner, enter "Application Name" and customize "Application ID" in the new window, and click "Create" to select the application type to get access.

- Application Name (required): The name of the application used to identify the current implementation of user access monitoring.
- Application ID (required): The unique identification of the application in the current workspace, which is used for SDK data collection and upload matching, and corresponds to the field: app_id after data entry. This field only supports English, numeric, underscore input, up to 48 characters.

| NPM                      | By packaging the SDK code together with your front-end project, this approach ensures that there will be no impact on the performance of the front-end pages, although requests, and errors collected prior to the initialization of the SDK may be missed. |
| CDN Asynchronous Loading | The SDK scripts are introduced as asynchronous scripts through CDN accelerated caching. This approach ensures that the download of SDK scripts does not affect the page loading performance, although requests, errors collected before the initialization of the SDK may be missed. |
| CDN Synchronous Loading  | The SDK scripts are introduced as synchronous scripts through CDN accelerated caching, this way you can ensure that all errors, resources, requests, performance metrics can be collected. However, it may affect the page loading performance. |

## Questions

### Reasons for Script Error Messages

When using DataFlux Web Rum Sdk for web-side error collection, you often see an error message like Script error. in `js_error` without any details included.

#### Possible Reasons for the Above Problem

1. The user is using a browser that does not support error catching (very unlikely).
2. The error script file is loaded to the page across the domain.
   We can't deal with the case that the user's browser doesn't support this; here we mainly address the reasons and solutions for not collecting cross-domain script errors.

In general, script files are loaded using the `<script>` tag. For homologous script errors, when using the browser's `GlobalEventHandlers API`, the error message collected will contain detailed error information; when a different source script error occurs, the error message collected will only be the `Script error.` text, which is controlled by the This is controlled by the browser's homology policy, and is the normal case. For non-homologous scripts we only need to do non-homologous resource sharing (also called HTTP access control / CORS).

### Solution

#### 1.Script files are stored directly on the server

Add Header to static file output on the server

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

Add the genus crossorigin="anonymous" to the Script tag where the non-homologous script is located

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/your/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

#### 2.Script files are stored on CDN

Add Header to the CDN settings

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

Add the genus crossorigin="anonymous" to the Script tag where the non-homologous script is located

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/your/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

#### 3.Script files are loaded from third parties

Add the genus crossorigin="anonymous" to the Script tag where the non-homologous script is located

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/your/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

### Incomplete Collection of Resource Data (ssl, tcp, dns, trans,ttfb)

During the data reporting process, some of the resource timing data may be collected incompletely. For example, tcp, dns data is not collected and reported.

### Reasons for the Above Problems

1. For example, if dns data is not collected, it is possible that this resource request of your application is kept linked with `keep-alive`, this situation is only when you make the first request, there will be the process of creating the link, after that the requests will keep the same connection and will not recreate the tcp connection. So there will be a situation where the dns data is not available, or the data is `0`.
2. The resources of the application are loaded to the page in the form of cross-domain, and your website is not the same source (the main reason).
3. The browser does not support the `Performance API` (very rare case)

### For Cross-Domain Resources {#header}

#### 1.Resource files are stored directly on the server

Add Header to resource file output on the server

```
Timing-Allow-Origin: *
```

#### 2. Resource files are stored on CDN

Add Header to the CDN settings

```
Timing-Allow-Origin: *
```
