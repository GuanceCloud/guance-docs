# Upload SourceMap during project build

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> currently provides a `webpack` plugin that can easily upload the corresponding directory's SourceMap files during the Web project build process, solving the cumbersome manual upload process.

**Note**: Currently supports uploads for Web applications.

## Preparation

1. [Obtain](../../open-api/index.md) the `OpenApi` domain address for the corresponding site;
2. In <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> [obtain](../../open-api/signature-certification.md) the required `OpenApi` `API KEY`;
3. On the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> platform, obtain the Web application's `applicationId`, `env`, and `version` information. If there is no application, you need to [create a new application](../web/app-access.md);
4. Preparation complete.

## Webpack

Install [@cloudcare/webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudcare/webpack-plugin)

```js
 npm install @cloudcare/webpack-plugin --D
```

Modify the `plugins` option in the `webpack.config.js` file

```js
// ....
const { GuanceSourceMapUploadWebpackPlugin } = require('@cloudcare/webpack-plugin')
module.exports = ({ mode }) => ({
  //.....
  devtool: 'hidden-source-map',
  plugins: [
    //.....
    new GuanceSourceMapUploadWebpackPlugin({
      applicationId: 'xxxxx', // <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> appid
      apiKey: 'xxxxxxxx', // open apikey
      server: 'https://console.guance-xxx.cn',
      filepaths: ['dist/'], // Directories or files to search
      logLevel: 'verbose', // Log print level, optional
      root: 'dist/', // Directory to calculate relative paths, optional
      env: 'production', // <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> application env, optional
      version: '1.0.0', // <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> application version, optional
    }),
  ],
})
```

### SourceMap WebpackPlugin Configuration Description

```typescript
interface Options {
  /**
   *
   * Files/directories to search for sourcemaps.
   * All files matching the "extensions configuration" list but not matching the "ignore configuration" will be searched for
   * sourcemap JSON or `//#sourceMappingURL=` comments, so generated files + source maps pairs are found, then source maps will be uploaded.
   */
  filepaths: Array<string> | string

  /**
   * OpenApi Key generated by the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> platform, refer to (<<< homepage >>>/management/api-key/open-api/#_1) for generation method.

  applicationId: string
  /**
   * RUM Application corresponding version (optional)
   */
  version?: string
  /**

  /**

### Whether SourceMap is Visible in Production Environment

In production environments, for security reasons, we typically do not retain SourceMap files. These files allow developers to map compressed or compiled code back to original source code, but if made public, they may expose the internal logic of applications, increasing security risks.

To safely handle SourceMaps, you can enable the deleteAfterUpload: true option when configuring GuanceSourceMapUploadWebpackPlugin. This way, once the SourceMap is uploaded to the server, it will be immediately deleted from the local file system, ensuring that they do not remain in the production environment.

Additionally, by setting Webpack's devtool to "hidden-source-map", you can generate SourceMaps without including any references to them in JavaScript files. This prevents browsers from attempting to download and view the source code.

If "hidden-source-map" is enabled, you should also set matchSourcemapsByFilename: true in the GuanceSourceMapUploadWebpackPlugin plugin. This configuration ensures that the plugin can identify and upload the corresponding SourceMap files based on the names of the JavaScript files, even if they are not explicitly referenced in the generated code.

Through these measures, you can maintain the convenience of debugging your application while effectively protecting your source code.

```js
 const { GuanceSourceMapUploadWebpackPlugin } = require('@cloudcare/webpack-plugin')
 = require('@cloudcare/webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  // Ensure that Webpack has been configured to output sourcemaps,
  // but without the `sourceMappingURL` references in build artifacts.
  devtool: 'hidden-source-map',
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // Enable our plugin to upload the sourcemaps once the build has completed.
    // This assumes NODE_ENV is how you distinguish production builds. If that
    // is not the case for you, you will have to tweak this logic.
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      ? [
          new GuanceSourceMapUploadWebpackPlugin({
            ...
            deleteAfterUpload: true,
            matchSourcemapsByFilename: true,
          }),
        ]
      : [],
  ],
}
```

### How to DEBUG

If SourceMaps are not found during runtime, you can set the environment variable `DEBUG=guance:sourcemap-upload` or configure `logLevel: verbose` and run the build command to view detailed logs.

### Precautions

### Node Version `> 10.13`

### `filepaths` and `root` Configuration Notes:

1. In the Guance console, there is an incorrect line in one of the errors `at SVGGElement.<anonymous> @ http://localhost:8000/js/chunk-vendors.732b3b98.js:1:93427`

2. The relative path of the file causing the error is `js/chunk-vendors.732b3b98.js`

3. If the js files are in the static directory on the server as `dist/js/*.js` `dist/js/*.js.map`

4. Plugin configuration `filepaths: ['dist']`

5. If `root` is not configured, the default value is `dist/`, and the final path of the uploaded SourceMap file to the Guance server is `dist/js/**.js.map`

6. In this case, there will be a mismatch between the **uploaded file directory path** and the **error-generating path**, so at this point, you should add the configuration `root:'/'` or `root: ''`, ensuring the upload directory path is `js/**.js.map`.
