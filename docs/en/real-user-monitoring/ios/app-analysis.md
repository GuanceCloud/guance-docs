# iOS/tvOS Application Analysis
---

## Introduction

After application data is collected into <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, you can view the application performance analysis through the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console.

## Explorer Analysis

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> provides a RUM Explorer to help you view and analyze detailed information about user visits to your application. Within the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> workspace, open **User Analysis**, click on any application, and use the **Explorer** to understand each user session, page performance, resources, long tasks, errors in operations, delays affecting users, and more. This allows you to gain a comprehensive understanding of the application's operational status and usage by searching, filtering, and correlating analysis, improving the application’s performance and user experience. For more details, refer to the documentation [Explorer](../explorer/index.md).

## Use Cases Analysis

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> offers visualized iOS application analysis with built-in monitoring solutions for iOS applications. You can go to **User Analysis** - «Analysis Dashboard» - «Mobile», select the iOS **Application ID**, and view overviews, performance analysis, resource analysis, and error analysis.

### Overview

The overview of iOS applications provides statistics on launch counts, PV numbers, page error rates, page load times, session analysis, performance analysis, and error analysis. It visually presents user access data from various aspects such as iOS app launches, session distribution, user devices, popular page rankings, page visit rankings, and resource error rankings. This helps quickly identify issues with user access to iOS applications and improve user access performance. You can filter by environment and version to view connected iOS applications.
