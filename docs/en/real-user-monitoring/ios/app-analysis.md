# iOS Application Analysis
---

## Overview

Application performance analysis can be viewed through the Guance Cloud console after application data has been collected to the Guance Cloud.

## Explorer Analysis

Guance Cloud provides Real User Monitoring explorer to help you view and analyze detailed information about user access to your applications. In "Real User Monitoring" , click on any application and then you can use "Explorer" to understand each user session, page performance, resources, long tasks, errors in action, the impact of latency on users, and help you fully understand and improve the operation status and usage of your application through search, filtering and correlation analysis to improve user experience. More details can be found in the documentation [Explorer](... /explorer/index.md).

## Scene Analysis
Guance Cloud provides visual iOS application analysis with multiple built-in iOS application monitoring solutions, including overview, performance analysis, resource analysis, and error analysis.

### Overview

The overview scenario of iOS application counts the startup times, PV numbers, page error rate, page loading time, session analysis, performance analysis, error analysis and other indicators of iOS access. From the aspects of iOS application startup, session distribution, access to user equipment, popular page ranking, page visits ranking, resource error ranking, etc., visually display the data statistics of users accessing iOS applications, quickly locate the problems of users accessing iOS applications, and improve user access performance. iOS applications that have been accessed can be viewed through environment and version filtering.

### Performance Analysis

Performance analysis of iOS applications, through statistics of PV number, page loading time, the number of most concerned page sessions, page long task analysis, resource analysis and other indicators, visually view the overall performance of iOS application pages in real time, more accurately locate the pages that need to be optimized, and screen and view the accessed iOS applications through environment and version.

### Resource Analysis

iOS application resource analysis, through statistical resource classification, XHR & Fetch analysis, resource time-consuming analysis and other indicators, visual real-time view of the overall iOS application resources; Through statistical resource request ranking, the resources that need to be optimized can be positioned more accurately; iOS applications that have been accessed can be filtered through environment and version.

### Error Analysis

JS error analysis of iOS application, through statistical error rate, Crash, Crash version, network error state distribution and other indicators, visually view the overall iOS application error situation in real time; Through the statistics of affected resource errors, resource errors can be quickly located; iOS applications that have been accessed can be filtered through environment and version.
