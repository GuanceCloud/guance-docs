# Metrics Collection
---


<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> has the capability to collect data across all domains, supporting various standard collectors that allow for quick configuration of data sources and easy collection of over a hundred types of data.

## Data Collection

Prerequisite: [DataKit has been installed](../datakit/datakit-install.md).

There are two ways to collect metrics:

1. Log in to the console, go to the **Integration** page, install DataKit, and then enable the collector for the metrics you need to collect;
2. Use the [DataKit API](../datakit/apis.md) to customize the [writing of metrics data](https://<<< custom_key.func_domain >>>/doc/practice-write-data-via-datakit/).
