## Overview

Guance has the ability of collecting global data, and the metric data obtained by the collector would be automatically reported to the workbench. You can analyze and manage the metric data in space uniformly through "Metrics".

## Application Scenarios

It is critical to ensure that systems are observable, maintainable and operational for organizations to ensure business continuity and service delivery. Therefore, it is particularly important to use a large number of metrics to measure the running status and service efficiency of systems, applications and businesses. The metric function of Guance can help you:

- Realize the metric observation requirements of various technology stacks, open source software and business.
- Visual analysis of metric change trend.
- Manage metric sets, metrics and tags in a unified way.

## Introduction on Functions

- **Metrics Analysis**: enabling you to visually query metric data in the form of sequence diagram based on Simple Query, Expression Query and DQL Query.
- **Metrics Management**: supporting unified viewing of all metric sets, metrics, tags, timeline quantities and metric data saving strategies in the current space. Here, you can also manually set the unit of metrics, add the description of metrics and so on.

## Step Description

- Step 1: Before using the "Metrics" function, you need to start the relevant integrated [Metrics Collection](https://docs.guance.com/metrics/collection/) through DataKit, and the successfully collected metric data would be automatically reported to the workbench.
- Step 2: All metric data reported to the workspace by DataKit collector can be viewed through Metrics Management, including metric set, metric (metric name, field type, unit, description), tag, etc.
- Step 3:  All metric data in the space can be queried and analyzed visually in "Metrics" and "Dashboard" of the console.
