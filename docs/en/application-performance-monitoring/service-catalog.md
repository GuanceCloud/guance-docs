## Introduction

Apply performance monitoring service list supports real-time viewing of ownership, dependency, performance, associated instrument version and association analysis of different services, quickly discovering and solving service performance problems, and helping teams efficiently build and managing large-scale end-to-end distributed applications.

In the service list, you can:

- Quickly obtain team ownership and emergency contact information of services, and establish connection with emergency contacts in time in case of performance failure.
- View and configure custom fields for service-associated log analysis.
- View the invocation map of the service to help quickly understand and analyze the upstream and downstream dependencies of the service.
- Real-time access to service resource performance metrics, including requests, errors and response times.
- Associate various custom instrumentation versions, and visually display the trend analysis of various metrics of service performance for different teams.

#### Association Analysis {#analysis}

When configuring the service list, it supports configuring the field values of the global link association log. After the configuration is completed, you can directly view the relevant log data based on the field values configured in the service list on the Link Details page and the Association Log page.

Note:

- On the log page of the link details page, the default includes three field options: "trace_id", "host" and "all sources". Select any option of the default field, and display `log=[]` in the service list "Association Analysis";
- The link details page log page and the service list association analysis configuration custom field influence each other, that is, if the custom field is configured on the link details page log page, `log=[]` displays the information of the custom field, and supports the configuration and display of multiple custom fields.
