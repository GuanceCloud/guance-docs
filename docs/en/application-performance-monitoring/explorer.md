# Traces

---

In the Guance console, you can view all related data in **APM > Trace**. You can search, filter, export trace data, view trace details, and perform a comprehensive analysis of trace performance through flame graphs, Span lists, etc. Both synchronous and asynchronous calls can clearly track the data details of each trace.

## Trace List

Guance provides three types of trace viewing lists, which are **All Spans**, **Entry Spans**, and **All Traces**.

A Span represents a logical unit of work in a distributed system within a given time period, and multiple Spans constitute a trace trajectory (trace).

<div class="grid" markdown>

=== "All Spans"

    Display all collected Span data within the currently selected time range.
    
    ![](img/4.apm_1.png)

=== "Entry Spans"

    Filter and display all Span data that first entered within the currently selected time range.
    
    ![](img/4.apm_2.png)

=== "All Traces"

    Filter and display all Trace data containing the initial top-level Span within the currently selected time range.

</div>

## Query and Analysis

- Time widget: The Trace explorer defaults to showing data from the last 15 minutes. You can customize the [time range](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#time) for data display.

- In the Trace explorer search bar, it supports [various search and filtering methods](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md).

    - **Note:** When you switch to view **service** or **trace** explorer, Guance defaults to retain your current filter conditions and time range.

- Analysis Mode: In the Trace explorer [analysis bar](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#analysis), you can perform multi-dimensional analysis statistics based on <u>1-3 tags</u> and support multiple data chart analysis methods.

- Quick Filter: Supports editing [quick filters](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#quick-filter), adding new filter fields.

- Filter History: Guance supports saving the explorer `key:value` search condition history in the [filter history](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#filter-history) and applying it to different explorers in the current workspace.

- Custom [display columns](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#columns): In the trace list, the default view is **time**, **trace ID**, **service**, **resource**, and **duration**, which can be customized to add, edit, delete, and drag display columns.

### Chart Statistics

In the trace explorer chart statistics, you can check the **Requests**, **Error Requests**, **Response Time** of different statuses of the trace within the selected time range, and you can filter the synchronous display chart statistics.

- Requests/Error Requests: Divide into 60 time points according to the selected time range, and use a histogram to statistically display requests and error requests for the trace.
- Response time: Divide into 60 time points according to the selected time range, and use a line graph to statistically display four response metrics, namely the average response time per second, P75 response time, P90 response time and P99 response time.

### Data Export

In the trace explorer, after filtering out the desired Trace data for viewing and analysis, you can export it to a CSV file or scenario dashboard and notes.

If you need to export a piece of data, open the details page of this piece of data, and click the :material-tray-arrow-up: icon in the upper right corner.

### Save as a Snapshot

Guance supports **viewing historical snapshots** to directly save the snapshot data of the current explorer. Through the [snapshot](../getting-started/function-details/snapshot.md) function, you can quickly reproduce instant copies of data and restore data to a certain point in time and a certain data display logic.

## Trace Details {#detail}

In the trace explorer, you can view the corresponding trace details by clicking on any trace, including the time, duration, HTTP method, HTTP URL, HTTP status code, TraceId, Flame, Span list, service call relationship and associated logs, hosts, metrics, networks, etc.

![](img/9.apm_explorer_6.1.png)

If the current trace belongs to a front-end application (such as: browser), you can view the request time distribution in the trace details, including the request time proportions of Queueing (queue), First Byte (first packet), Download (download).

???+ warning

    The RUM SDK must be 2.2.10 and above to see this part of the data display. If there is a cross-domain situation, the header configuration needs to be adjusted.

    > For more details, see [Web Application Access](../real-user-monitoring/web/app-access.md#header).

### Flame {#flame}

The flame graph can clearly show the flow and execution time of each Span in the entire trace. You can view the corresponding service list and response time on the right side of the flame graph. Click on the Span in the flame graph, in the **Trace Details Page** you can view the corresponding Json content, you can view specific Span information by zooming in and out with the mouse wheel.

> For more details on the application of the flame graph, see [Skillfully Use Flame Graph to Analyze Trace Performance](../best-practices/monitoring/trace-glame-graph.md).

<div class="grid" markdown>

=== "Flame Graph Trace Explanation"

    ![](img/13.apm_flame.png)

    From the flame graph above, it can be seen that this call trace includes two services, namely <u>CloudCare and Mysql</u>. The trace starts with the POST request initiated by the CloudCare service, then executes `ActionResource.executeAction`, and finally executes the Mysql statement. During the entire process of executing `ActionResource.executeAction`, the Mysql statement is executed multiple times. The execution time of CloudCare and Mysql is calculated as follows:

    - Execution time of CloudCare service = D1+D2+D3+D4+D5+D6+D7+D8+D9+D10+D11
    - Execution time of Mysql service = span2+span3+......+span11

    ![](img/span_2.png)

    The details of the specific execution statement and execution time can be referred to the Span list.

=== "Calculation of Execution Time Proportion"

    The service execution time proportion in the flame graph refers to the ratio of each service to the total time in this call trace. Below is an example, this call trace contains two services, namely CloudCare and Mysql, the execution time proportions are 42.37% and 57.63% respectively. The CloudCare service has 2 Spans, and the Mysql service has 10 Spans.

    - Calculation method of Mysql service execution time proportion: the total execution time of all spans / the total duration of the current call trace.

    Calculation method explanation: The Mysql service in the figure below has a total of 10 Span quantities. You can click on each Span to get the execution time of the current Span. From the figure, you can see that the execution time of this Span is 5.08ms, and then in the same way, get the remaining 9 The execution time of a Span is added.

    ![](img/13.apm_flame_0.1.png)

    - Calculation method of CloudCare service execution time proportion: (current call trace total duration-mysql service execution time)/current call trace total duration

    Calculation method explanation: The CloudCare service in the figure below runs through the entire current call trace. Except for the execution time of the mysql service, the remaining time is the execution time of the CloudCare service (see the execution time of the marked red line part). The execution time proportion can also be directly viewed through the Span list to view the execution time and execution time proportion of each Span.

    ![](img/13.apm_flame.png)

=== "Asynchronous Call"

    In the flame graph, whether the service is a synchronous or asynchronous call, each trace performance data detail can be clearly tracked. For example, through the flame graph, you can clearly see which requests are performed asynchronously, the start time, end tim and total time spent.

    ![](img/9.apm_explorer_19.2.png)

</div>

### Span List

Display the total Span quantity and its list in this trace, including **Resource**, **Span Quantity**, **Duration**, **Execution Time** and **Proportion**.

You can search for Span. Click on any Span. In **Trace Details**, you can view the corresponding JSON content. Switch to the flame graph to synchronously display Span. If there are errors, error prompts will be displayed before Span.

![](img/9.apm_explorer_18.png)

#### Waterfall Chart {#waterfall}

In the Span list, click :material-chart-waterfall: to view the parent-child relationship between resources.

The waterfall chart displays Span data in order of start time. The left side list displays Span data and shows the execution time proportion of each resource. The right side displays the waterfall chart in order of time.

You can also search for Span in the üîç bar. The fuzzy search results of the resource (`resource`) field will be highlighted.
