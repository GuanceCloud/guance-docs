# Log Blacklist
---

## Overview

Guance provides you with comprehensive log collection capabilities. It supports the collection of log data generated by Windows/Linux/MacOS hosts, Web servers, virtual machines, network devices, security devices, databases, etc. However, as the collected logs will contain some logs that you don't need, Guance provides you with the function of **Log Blacklist**, that is, by adding log filtering rules, log data conforming to the rules can be filtered to prevent reporting to the workspace and help you save log data storage costs.

## Precondition

You need to create a [Guance account](https://www.guance.com) and [install DataKit](../../datakit/datakit-install.md) on your host to start the related integration and collect data.

## Roles of Log Blacklist

### a. economical
In Guance, the billing methods for log data are as follows:

| **Billing Item** | **Billing Unit** | **Commercial Plan Gradient Price** |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data storage policy |  | 7 days | 14 days | 30 days | 60 days |
| Number of log data | per million | 짜 1.2 | 짜 1.5 | 짜 2 | 짜 2.5 |

Taking the log data generated by *usability dialing test as an example*, we created a node in Beijing and dialed the site of our company once every minute. At this time, a log will be generated every minute and uploaded to the workspace. We pay more attention to the time when the dial test of this node timeout and fails, so we can use our log blacklist function to filter the log whose dial test status is OK, thus greatly saving the data cost.

### b. not bothering

The log blacklist configuration takes effect immediately after success, which is common to all users in the whole workspace, and only needs to be configured once, which takes effect permanently. Standard members above can create and edit blacklist configuration.

### c. time-saving

By using the log blacklist function, you can reduce the collection of invalid logs, present more valid information in the workspace, and make it easier for you to find the target logs more quickly.

## How to use the log blacklist feature

As shown in the following figure; Select the log source `http_dail_testing` and filter the log data of `status=OK` and `city=hangzhou`, that is, the log data that meets the filter criteria at the same time will not be reported to the workspace.
