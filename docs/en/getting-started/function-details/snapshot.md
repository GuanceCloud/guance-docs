# Snapshot
---

This creates a data copy for custom time periods of various explorers (such as scenario dashboards, infrastructure, metrics, logs, etc.), and generates quick access links with specified viewing permissions.

- [**Save Snapshot**](./save-snapshot.md): Quickly record real data at the moment of an anomaly to help pinpoint issues.  
- [**Share Snapshot**](./share-snapshot.md): Under the premise of isolated data permissions, improve collaboration efficiency across teams or with partners.


## Permission Differentiation {#permission}

- [Default Roles](../../management/role-management.md#descrip): Only the workspace owner (Owner) and administrator (Administrator) have the permissions to save, share, and manage snapshots;
- [Customized Roles](../../management/role-management.md#customized-roles): Relevant snapshot permissions can be granted through customized roles.
