# Snapshot
---

This involves creating custom time period copies for various explorers (such as scenario dashboards, infrastructure, metrics, logs, etc.), generating data replicas, and creating shortcut access links with specified viewing permissions.

- [**Save Snapshot**](./save-snapshot.md): Quickly record real data at the moment of an anomaly to help pinpoint issues.  
- [**Share Snapshot**](./share-snapshot.md): Under the premise of isolated data permissions, improve collaboration efficiency across teams or with partners.


## Permission Differentiation {#permission}

- [Default Roles](../../management/role-management.md#descrip): Only the workspace owner (Owner) and administrator (Administrator) have the permissions to save, share, and manage snapshots.
- [Custom Roles](../../management/role-management.md#customized-roles): Related snapshot permissions can be granted through custom roles.
