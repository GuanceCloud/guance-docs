A mesurement can contain multiple metrics.<br/><li>[Metrics](../../metrics/dictionary.md): The DataWay gateway finally reports the data to the DataFlux center for storage. The metric is divided into two parts: metric name and metric value. The metric name only identifies an alias of the metric, and the metric value refers to the specific value of the metric when collecting. <br/><li>[Label](../../metrics/dictionary.md)l: A collection of attributes that identifies a data point collection object. Labels are divided into label names and label values. A data point can have multiple labels. For example, the collected metric "cpu usage" will identify attribute information such as host, os and product. These attributes are collectively referred to as tags.<br/><li>[Timeseries](../../metrics/dictionary.md): The number of all combinations that can be combined based on labels in the reported metric data in the current workspace. In Guance, the timeseries is composed of metrics, labels (fields) and data storage time, and "metrics" and "combination of labels (fields)" are the primary keys of data storage. |
