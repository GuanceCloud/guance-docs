# Customer Value
---

Using Guance will give users the following value enhancements compared to open source products.

| Scene | Self-built Open Source Product | Guance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Building a Monitoring System for the Cloud Era** | Dedicated technical team for at least 3 months, and that's just for early stage. | 30 minutes out of the box. |
| **Related Cost Investment** | A simple open source monitoring product hardware investment requires more than 20,000 / year, if the cloud era observable platform is at least 100,000 / year fixed investment (estimated in cloud hardware). | Pay-as-you-go, flexible cost based on actual business situation, overall cost is more than 50 % lower than the combined investment of using open source products. |
| **System Maintenance Management** | It requires the long-term attention and investment of professional technical engineers, a variety of open source products mixed use also increases the complexity of management. | No need for extra attention, sparing time to focus on business problems. |
| **Number of Robes to Be Installed on the Server** | Each open source software requires a probe, and a lot of server performance is taken up by the probe. | One probe, fully based on binary operation with extremely low CPU and memory footprint. |
| **Value Delivered** | Depend on the ability of the company's own engineers and their ability to drill down into open source products. | All-around data-based platform with full observability, allowing engineers to use data to solve problems. |
| **Root Cause Analysis of Performance and Failure** | Depend on the team's own capabilities. | Quick location based on data analysis. |
| **Security** | A variety of mixed open source software, testing the overall ability of technical engineers. | Comprehensive security scanning and testing, customer-side code open-sourced to users and products iteratively updated in a timely manner to ensure security. |
| **Scalability and Services** | Need to build one's own team of SRE engineers. | Professional services equivalent to deploying an external SRE support team. |
| **Training and Support** | Hire teachers from outside. | Long-term online training support. |

The above diagram shows that a team's investment in overall system stability assurance can actually be massive, not only the cost of the software itself, which usually does not seem to cost money for open source software, but the corresponding investment in cloud or physical servers, the time investment and even the duplication of investment due to the change of technical teams can occur. A team should be more efficient to protect its business development, rather than invest a lot of costs in their own unprofessional things. Professional things should be left to professional services to perform.

In fact, a team often invests more than 30%-50% of the overall cost of building and maintaining the system. This includes the server resources eaten by various open source probes, the deployment of open source software itself server input and the corresponding maintenance monitoring system input. In addition, the development, testing, and maintenance engineers spend a lot of energy on identifying various failure anomalies during their work and also **consume a lot of work time**. This does not include the loss of business due to system failure without building observability, which are **hidden costs**. The real problem for teams that don't use a robust observability platform is that they are investing a lot of hidden costs and wasting a lot of time.

**Choosing Guance allows a technical team to not only get a very powerful observable product, but also save a lot of explicit and implicit costs in system assurance. Most importantly, it allows each team to focus on their own business.**ã€‚
