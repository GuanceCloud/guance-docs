## Observability

In the cloud native era, enterprises mostly adopt micro-services, containers, Serverless and other deployment methods on their path to follow the changes of IT architecture and the practice of cloud native technology. Meanwhile, it is necessary to integrate the perspective of development and business departments and has a wider and more active ability than the original monitoring, which leads to the traditional monitoring technology and tools. This can no longer meet the requirements of enterprises for the controllability and stability of complex IT systems.

In 2018, CNCF took the lead in introducing the word <font color="coral">**observability**</font> into the IT field, and said that observability is a necessary capability in the original era of cloud. Since then, **observability** has become one of the hottest topics in the field of cloud native technology. Subsequently, CNCF published ***[White Paper on Observability](https://github.com/cncf/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper.md)***
([:material-hand-pointing-right:Chinese version](https://github.com/chenmudu/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper-zh.md)), which is introduced in detail. The "three observability signals" mentioned in IT, namely Metrics, Logs and Traces, have also become general knowledge in IT field.


## Guance

Based on the prediction and firmness of IT observability, our company started to build **"Systematic Observable Platform in Cloud Age——<font color="coral">Guance</font>”** as early as 2018. After five years of careful polishing by professional teams, Guance product was officially released on April 28, 2022.<br/>
After being put into the market, Guance still keeps the update frequency of [“two-week iteration”](../../release-notes/index.md) for many years, actively collects feedback from different types of users, continuously expands the coverage rate of various technology stacks, optimizes the user experience of product usage details and improves the strong stability of public cloud and privatized platform.

As a unified real-time monitoring application with observability, [Guance](https://www.guance.one/) can help users quickly realize system observability, uniformly meet the monitoring requirements related to cloud platform, cloud native, application and business, and build **full link observability** for each complete application. Moreover, Guance is unwilling to be limited to the observability on the "observability three signals"; It also hopes to help enterprises further pursue the observability of "test, advance and production environment"; Even in the whole enterprise architecture, "development, testing, operation and maintenance teams" are effectively connected to realize **the observability of the whole life cycle of software development**.


## Core Modules

As a platform for the observability of the whole link of the application system, Guance can also be understood as a **"powerful data analysis platform"**. Compared with the data flow trend of observability, several core modules of Guance also run through it.
