# DataFlux Func
---

DataFlux Func is a Python-based script development, management and execution platform.

Formerly a function calculation component under [Guance](https://en.guance.com/), it has become an independent system.

It is mainly divided into two parts:

- Server: Built with Node.js + Express, it mainly provides Web UI service and external API interface.
- Worker: Built using Python 3 + Celery, it mainly provides the execution environment of Python scripts (including Beat module).

## DataFlux Func (Automata) {#steps}

Guance supports the one-click opening service of DataFlux Func (Automata). After the opening is completed, Func can be automatically deployed in the cloud host, and you can quickly log in to the corresponding Func platform through **Integrations** in the workspace.

### One-click Opening

???+ attention "Permission and Charge"

    - Only one Automata can be opened on one workspace, and only **Owner** has installation and configuration permission;
    - Automata <u>charges monthly</u>, deducting one month's fee once it is successfully opened, and automatically deducting the next month's fee one day before the expiration date (for example, if it is opened on 04/13, it will be deducted on 04/12, 05/12 and so on...).

#### Application Expiration

If you have opened Automata before, after the application expires, we will keep all the data for you for <u>7 days</u> and release it when it expires. Within these 7 days, if you need to open the application again, you can choose to restore all the data or not:

- Restore Data: backup the previously reserved data to the newly opened RUM;  
- Not recover data: Discard all previous data and [reopen the application](#steps).
