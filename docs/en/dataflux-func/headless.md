# RUM Headless

RUM is used to collect user access monitoring data reported from web or mobile ends. <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> provides a one-click activation service for RUM. After activation, it automatically installs and deploys on <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> cloud servers, automatically completing DataKit installation, RUM collector deployment, and other operations.
