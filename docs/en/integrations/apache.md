The Apache collector gathers request counts, connection counts, and other data from Apache services, sending metrics to <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> for monitoring and analysis of various Apache anomalies.

## Configuration {#config}

### Prerequisites {#requirements}

- Apache version >= `2.4.6 (Unix)`. Tested versions:
    - [x] 2.4.56
    - [x] 2.4.54
    - [x] 2.4.41
    - [x] 2.4.38
    - [x] 2.4.29
    - [x] 2.4.6

- Default configuration paths:
    - */etc/apache2/apache2.conf*
    - */etc/apache2/httpd.conf*
    - */usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf*

- Enable Apache `mod_status`, by adding the following in the Apache configuration file:

```xml
<Location /server-status>
SetHandler server-status

Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from [YOUR_IP]
</Location>
```

- Restart Apache

```shell
$ sudo apachectl restart
...
```

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "HOST Installation"

    Navigate to the `conf.d/apache` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `apache.conf.sample` and rename it to `apache.conf`. Example as follows:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.apache]]
      url = "http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto"
      # ##(optional) collection interval, default is 30s
      # interval = "30s"
    
      # username = ""
      # password = ""
    
      ## Optional TLS Config
      # tls_ca = "/xxx/ca.pem"
      # tls_cert = "/xxx/cert.cer"
      # tls_key = "/xxx/key.key"
      ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
      insecure_skip_verify = false
    
      ## Set true to enable election
      election = true
    
      # [inputs.apache.log]
      # files = []
      # #grok pipeline script path
      # pipeline = "apache.p"
    
      [inputs.apache.tags]
      # some_tag = "some_value"
      # more_tag = "some_other_value"
      # ... 
    ```

    After configuring, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    Currently, you can enable the collector by injecting its configuration via [ConfigMap](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

## Measurement {#metric}

All the collected data will append global election tags by default. You can also specify additional tags through `[inputs.apache.tags]` in the configuration:

``` toml
 [inputs.apache.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```



### `apache` {#apache}

The collected Metrics are influenced by the environment where Apache is installed. The metrics shown on the `http://<your-apache-server>/server-status?auto` page will prevail.

## LOG Collection {#logging}

To collect Apache logs, open the `files` option in `apache.conf` and input the absolute path of the Apache log files. For example:

```toml
[[inputs.apache]]
  ...
  [inputs.apache.log]
    files = [
      "/var/log/apache2/error.log",
      "/var/log/apache2/access.log"
    ]
```

After enabling log collection, logs with source (`source`) set to `apache` will be generated by default.

    DataKit must be installed on the HOST where Apache is located to collect Apache logs.
