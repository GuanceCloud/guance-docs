## Installation and Deployment {#config}

Note: The example ZooKeeper version is 3.6.3 (CentOS). Versions 3.6 and above provide many more metrics compared to previous versions. If you are using a version prior to 3.6, some metrics might not be collected.

### Enable Zookeeper Metrics

- Enable the Metrics Providers configuration in Zookeeper (default configuration file location: Zookeeper installation directory `/conf/zoo.cfg`) and add `4lw.commands.whitelist=*`

```shell
> ## Metrics Providers
> #
> # [https://prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io) Metrics Exporter
> metricsProvider.className=org.apache.zookeeper.metrics.prometheus.PrometheusMetricsProvider
> metricsProvider.httpPort=7000
> metricsProvider.exportJvmInfo=true
> 4lw.commands.whitelist=*
```

- Restart the ZooKeeper cluster to apply the configuration.
- Download and install [zookeeper_exporter](https://github.com/carlpett/zookeeper_exporter/releases/download/v1.1.0/zookeeper_exporter), then use `chmod +x` to grant execution permissions and start it. The default port is 9141, and you can verify the data using the following command:

```bash
[root@d ~]# curl 0.0.0.0:9141/metrics
zk_sync_process_time{quantile="0_5",zk_host="172.16.0.196:2181"} NaN

zk_write_final_proc_time_ms_count{zk_host="172.16.0.194:2181"} 0.0

zk_connection_token_deficit_count{zk_host="172.16.0.23:2181"} 2.0
......
```

### Enable DataKit Collector

- Enable the DataKit Prom plugin and copy the sample file

```bash
/usr/local/datakit/conf.d/prom
cp prom.conf.sample prom.conf
```

- Modify the `prom.conf` configuration file

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

??? quote "Configuration as follows"

    ```toml
    [[inputs.prom]]
    ## Exporter URLs
    urls = ["[http://127.0.0.1:9141/metrics"]](http://127.0.0.1:9141/metrics")

    ## Ignore request errors for URL
    ignore_req_err = false

    ## Collector alias
    source = "zookeeper"

    ## Output source for collected data
    # Configuring this option allows writing collected data to a local file instead of sending it to the center
    # Later, you can directly debug the saved Metrics with the command `datakit --prom-conf /path/to/this/conf`
    # If the URL is configured as a local file path, the `--prom-conf` option takes precedence in debugging the data at the output path
    # output = "/abs/path/to/file"
    > 
    ## Upper limit for the size of collected data, in bytes
    # When outputting data to a local file, you can set an upper limit for the size of collected data
    # If the size of collected data exceeds this limit, the data will be discarded
    # The default upper limit for the size of collected data is set to 32MB
    # max_file_size = 0

    ## Metric type filtering, optional values are counter, gauge, histogram, summary
    # By default, only counter and gauge types of metrics are collected
    # If empty, no filtering is applied
    metric_types = ["counter", "gauge"]

    ## Metric name filtering
    # Supports regex, multiple configurations can be made, satisfying any one of them is enough
    # If empty, no filtering is applied
    # metric_name_filter = ["cpu"]

    ## Prefix for metric set names
    # Configuring this option adds a prefix to the metric set name
    measurement_prefix = ""

    ## Metric set name
    # By default, the metric name is split by underscores "_", the first field after splitting becomes the metric set name, and the remaining fields become the current metric name
    # If `measurement_name` is configured, the metric name will not be split
    # The final metric set name will have the `measurement_prefix` prefix added
    # measurement_name = "prom"

    ## Collection interval "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"
    interval = "10s"

    ## Filter tags, multiple tags can be configured
    # Matching tags will be ignored
    # tags_ignore = ["xxxx"]

    ## TLS configuration
    tls_open = false
    # tls_ca = "/tmp/ca.crt"
    # tls_cert = "/tmp/peer.crt"
    # tls_key = "/tmp/peer.key"

    ## Custom authentication method, currently only supports Bearer Token
    # Only one of token or token_file needs to be configured
    # [inputs.prom.auth]
    # type = "bearer_token"
    # token = "xxxxxxxx"
    # token_file = "/tmp/token"

    ## Custom metric set names
    # Metrics containing the prefix `prefix` can be grouped into one metric set
    # Custom metric set name configuration takes precedence over the `measurement_name` option
    #[[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    #  prefix = "cpu_"
    #  name = "cpu"

    # [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    # prefix = "mem_"
    # name = "mem"

    ## Custom Tags
    [inputs.prom.tags]
      service = "zookeeper"
    # more_tag = "some_other_value"
    ```

- Restart DataKit (if log collection is required, configure it before restarting)

```bash
systemctl restart datakit
```

- Verify with DQL

```bash
[root@df-solution-ecs-018 prom]# datakit -Q

Flag -Q deprecated, please use datakit help to use recommend flags.
