# Container Logs

---

Datakit supports collecting Kubernetes and host container logs, which can be classified into the following two types based on the data source:

- Console output: This refers to the stdout/stderr output of the container application, which is the most common way. It can be viewed using commands like `docker logs` or `kubectl logs`.

- Container internal files: If the logs are not output to stdout/stderr, they are usually stored in files. Collecting this type of logs requires mounting.

This article will provide a detailed introduction to these two collection methods.

## Logging Collection for Console stdout/stderr {#logging-stdout}

Console output (stdout/stderr) is written to files by the container runtime, and Datakit automatically fetches the LogPath of the container for collection.

If you want to customize the collection configuration, it can be done through adding container environment variables or Kubernetes Pod Annotations.

- The following are the key scenarios for custom configurations:

  - For container environment variables, the key must be set as `DATAKIT_LOGS_CONFIG`.
  - For Pod Annotations, there are two possible formats:
    - `datakit/$CONTAINER_NAME.logs`, where `$CONTAINER_NAME` needs to be replaced with the current Pod's container name. This format is used in multi-container environments.
    - `datakit/logs` applies to all containers of the Pod.

    If a container has an environment variable `DATAKIT_LOGS_CONFIG` and can also find the Annotation `datakit/logs` of its corresponding Pod, the configuration from the container environment variable will take precedence.

- The value for custom configurations is as follows:

``` json
[
  {
    "disable" : false,
    "source"  : "<your-source>",
    "service" : "<your-service>",
    "pipeline": "<your-pipeline.p>",
    "tags" : {
      "<some-key>" : "<some_other_value>"
    }
  }
]
```

| `disable`            | true/false        | Whether to disable log collection for the container. The default value is `false`.                                                                                   |
| `type`               | `file`/empty      | The type of collection. If collecting logs from container internal files, it must be set as `file`. The default value is empty, which means collecting `stdout/stderr`. |
| `path`               | string            | The configuration file path. If collecting logs from container internal files, it should be set as the path of the volume, which is accessible from outside the container. The default is not required when collecting `stdout/stderr`.                      |
| `source`             | string            | The source of the logs. Refer to [Configuring the Source for Container Log Collection](container.md#config-logging-source).                                         |
| `service`            | string            | The service to which the logs belong. The default value is the log source (`source`).                                                                                |
| `pipeline`           | string            | The Pipeline script for processing the logs. The default value is the script name that matches the log source (`<source>.p`).                                      |
| `multiline_match`    | regular expression string | The pattern used for recognizing the first line of a [multiline log match](logging.md#multiline), e.g., `"multiline_match":"^\\d{4}"` indicates that the first line starts with four digits. In regular expression rules, `\d` represents a digit, and the preceding `\` is used for escaping. |
| `character_encoding` | string            | The character encoding. If the encoding is incorrect, the data may not be viewable. Supported values are `utf-8`, `utf-16le`, `utf-16le`, `gbk`, `gb18030`, or an empty string. The default is empty.                                                |
| `tags`               | key/value pairs   | Additional tags to be added. If there are duplicate keys, the value in this configuration will take precedence ([:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.4.6](../datakit/changelog.md#cl-1.4.6)).                                                     |

???+ attention

    - If not necessary, avoid configuring the Pipeline in environment variables and Pod Annotations. In general, it can be automatically inferred through the `source` field.
    - When adding Env/Annotations in configuration files or terminal commands, both sides should be enclosed in double quotes with escape characters.
    
    The value of `multiline_match` requires double escaping, with 4 backslashes representing a single one. For example, `\"multiline_match\":\"^\\\\d{4}\"` is equivalent to `"multiline_match":"^\d{4}"`. Here's an example:

    ```shell
    kubectl annotate pods my-pod datakit/logs="[{\"disable\":false,\"source\":\"log-source\",\"service\":\"log-service\",\"pipeline\":\"test.p\",\"only_images\":[\"image:<your_image_regexp>\"],\"multiline_match\":\"^\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}\"}]"
    ```
    If a Pod/Container log is already being collected, adding configuration via the `kubectl annotate` command does not take effect.


## Logging for Log Files Inside Containers {#logging-with-inside-config}

For log files inside containers, the configuration is similar to logging console output, except that you need to specify the file path. Other configurations are mostly the same.


???+ attention

    The configured file path is not the path inside the container but the path accessible from the outside through volume.
    
    Similarly, you can add the configuration either as a container environment variable or a Kubernetes Pod Annotation. The key and value remain the same as mentioned earlier. Please refer to the previous section for details.

    ```


For log files inside containers, in a Kubernetes environment, you can also achieve collection by adding a sidecar. Please refer to [here](logfwd.md) for more information.

### Adjust Log Collection According to Container Image {#logging-with-image-config}

By default, DataKit collects stdout/stderr logs for all containers on your machine/Node, which may not be expected. Sometimes, we want to collect only (or not) the logs of some containerss, where the target container/Pod can be indirectly referred to by the mirror name.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "host installation"

    ``` toml
    ## When the container's image matches `hello*` , the container's log is collected
    container_include_log = ["image:hello*"]
    ## Ignore all containers
    container_exclude_log = ["image:*"]
    ```

    `container_include` and `container_exclude` must begin with `image` in the form of a [regular-like Glob wildcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)){:target="_blank"}： `"image:<glob rules>"`


<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Kubernetes"

    The following environment variables can be used

    - ENV_INPUT_CONTAINER_CONTAINER_INCLUDE_LOG
    - ENV_INPUT_CONTAINER_CONTAINER_EXCLUDE_LOG

    to configure log collection for the container. Suppose there are three Pods whose images are:

    - A：`hello/hello-http:latest`
    - B：`world/world-http:latest`
    - C：`registry.jiagouyun.com/datakit/datakit:1.2.0`

    If you want to collect only the logs of Pod A, configure  ENV_INPUT_CONTAINER_CONTAINER_INCLUDE_LOG.

    ``` yaml
    - env:
      - name: ENV_INPUT_CONTAINER_CONTAINER_INCLUDE_LOG
        value: image:hello*  # Specify the image name or its wildcard
    ```


???+ tip "How to view a mirror"

    Docker：

    ``` shell
    docker inspect --format "{{.Config.Image}}" $CONTAINER_ID
    ```

    Kubernetes Pod：

    ``` shell
    echo `kubectl get pod -o=jsonpath="{.items[0].spec.containers[0].image}"`
    ```

<!-- markdownlint-enable -->


???+ attention

    The priority of the global configuration `container_exclude_log` is lower than the custom configuration `disable` within the container. For example, if `container_exclude_log = ["image:*"]` is configured to exclude all logs, but there is a Pod Annotation as follows:
    
    ```json
    [
      {
          "disable": false,
          "type": "file",
          "path":"/tmp/opt/log",
          "source":  "logging-file",
          "tags" : {
            "some_tag": "some_value"
          }
      },
      {
          "disable": true,
          "source":  "logging-output"
      }
    ]"
    ```
    
    This configuration is closer to the container and has a higher priority. The `disable=false` in the configuration indicates that log files should be collected, overriding the global configuration.

    Therefore, the log files for this container will still be collected, but the stdout/stderr console output will not be collected because of disable=true.


## FAQ {#faq}

### :material-chat-question: Issue with Soft Links in Log Directories {#log-path-link}

Normally, Datakit retrieves the path of log files from the container/Kubernetes API and collects the file accordingly.

However, in some special environments, a soft link may be created for the directory containing the log file, and Datakit is unable to know the target of the soft link in advance, which prevents it from mounting the directory and collecting the log file.

For example, suppose a container log file is located at `/var/log/pods/default_log-demo_f2617302-9d3a-48b5-b4e0-b0d59f1f0cd9/log-output/0.log`. In the current environment, `/var/log/pods` is a soft link pointing to `/mnt/container_logs`, as shown below:

```shell
root@node-01:~# ls /var/log -lh
total 284K
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   20 Oct  8 10:06 pods -> /mnt/container_logs/
```

To enable Datakit to collect the log file, `/mnt/container_logs` hostPath needs to be mounted. For example, the following can be added to `datakit.yaml`:

```yaml
    # .. omitted..
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: datakit
        image: pubrepo.jiagouyun.com/datakit/datakit:1.16.0
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /mnt/container_logs
          name: container-logs
      # .. omitted..
      volumes:
      - hostPath:
          path: /mnt/container_logs
        name: container-logs
```

This situation is not very common and is usually only executed when it is known in advance that there is a soft link in the path or when Datakit logs indicate collection errors.

### :material-chat-question: Source Setting for Container Log Collection {#config-logging-source}

In the container environment, the log `source` setting is a very important configuration item, which directly affects the display effect on the page. However, it would be cruel to configure a source for each container's logs one by one. Without manually configuring the container log source, DataKit has the following rule (descending priority) for automatically inferring the source of the container log:


???+ attention

    The so-called not manually specifying the container log source means that it is not specified in Pod Annotation or in container.conf (currently there is no configuration item specifying the container log source in container.conf).


- Container's own name: The name that can be seen through `docker ps` or `crictl ps`.
- Container name specified by Kubernetes: Obtained from the `io.kubernetes.container.name` label of the container.
- `default`: Default `source`.

## Extended Reading {#more-reading}

- [Pipeline: Text Data Processing](../developers/pipeline/index.md)
- [Overview of DataKit Log Collection](datakit-logging.md)
Therefore, the log files for this container will still be collected, but the stdout/stderr console output will not be collected because of `disable=true`.
