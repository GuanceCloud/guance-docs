SQL Server Collector collects SQL Server `waitstats`, `database_io` and other related metrics.

## Prerequisites {#requrements}

- SQL Server version >= 2019

- Create a user:

Linux、Windows:

```
USE master;
GO
CREATE LOGIN [guance] WITH PASSWORD = N'yourpassword';
GO
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [guance];
GO
GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [guance];
GO
```

aliyun RDS SQL Server:

```
USE master;
GO
CREATE LOGIN [guance] WITH PASSWORD = N'yourpassword';
GO

```

## Configuration {#config}

=== "Host Installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/db` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `sqlserver.conf.sample` and name it `sqlserver.conf`. Examples are as follows:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.sqlserver]]
      ## your sqlserver host ,example ip:port
      host = ""
    
      ## your sqlserver user,password
      user = ""
      password = ""
    
      ## (optional) collection interval, default is 10s
      interval = "10s"
    
      ## by default, support TLS 1.2 and above.
      ## set to true if server side uses TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1
      allow_tls10 = false
    
      ## Set true to enable election
      election = true
    
      ## Database name to query. Default is master.
      database = "master"
    
      ## configure db_filter to filter out metrics from certain databases according to their database_name tag.
      ## If leave blank, no metric from any database is filtered out.
      # db_filter = ["some_db_instance_name", "other_db_instance_name"]
    
    
      ## Run a custom SQL query and collect corresponding metrics.
      #
      # [[inputs.sqlserver.custom_queries]]
      #   sql = '''
      #     select counter_name,cntr_type,cntr_value
      #     from sys.dm_os_performance_counters
      #   '''
      #   metric = "sqlserver_custom_stat"
      #   tags = ["counter_name","cntr_type"]
      #   fields = ["cntr_value"]
    
      # [inputs.sqlserver.log]
      # files = []
      # #grok pipeline script path
      # pipeline = "sqlserver.p"
    
      [inputs.sqlserver.tags]
      # some_tag = "some_value"
      # more_tag = "some_other_value"
    
    ```
    
    After configuration, restart DataKit.

=== "Kubernetes"

    The collector can now be turned on by [ConfigMap Injection Collector Configuration](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).

## Metrics {#measurements}

For all of the following data collections, a global tag name `host` is appended by default (the tag value is the host name of the DataKit), or other tags can be specified in the configuration by `[inputs.sqlserver.tags]`:

``` toml
 [inputs.sqlserver.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```

## Collec SQLServer running logging {#logging}

???+ attention

    DataKit must be installed on the host where SQLServer is running.

To collect SQL Server logs, enable `files` in *sqlserver.conf* and write to the absolute path of the SQL Server log file. For example:

```toml hl_lines="4"
[[inputs.sqlserver]]
	...
	[inputs.sqlserver.log]
		files = ["/var/opt/mssql/log/error.log"]
```

When log collection is turned on, a log with a log (aka *source*) of`sqlserver` is collected.

### Pipeline for  SQLServer logging {#pipeline}

- SQL Server common log pipeline

Example of common log text:

```
2021-05-28 10:46:07.78 spid10s     0 transactions rolled back in database 'msdb' (4:0). This is an informational message only. No user action is required
```

The list of extracted fields are as follows:

| Field Name | Field Value         | Description                                                                                |
| ---        | ---                 | ---                                                                                        |

| `time`     | 1622169967780000000 | nanosecond timestamp (as row protocol time)                                                |
| `origin`   | spid10s             | source                                                                                     |
| `status`   | info                | As the log does not have an explicit field to describe the log level, the default is info. |
