MongoDB DATABASE, Collection, MongoDB DATABASE cluster running status data collection.

## Configuration {#config}

### Prerequisites {#requirements}

- Tested versions:
    - [x] 6.0
    - [x] 5.0
    - [x] 4.0
    - [x] 3.0
    - [x] 2.8.0

- Development uses MongoDB version `4.4.5`;
- Write the configuration file in the corresponding directory and start DataKit to complete the configuration;
- Use TLS for secure connections by configuring the paths of the certificate files under `## TLS connection config` in the configuration file;
- If MongoDB starts with access control, configure the necessary user permissions to establish an authorized connection:

```sh
# Run MongoDB shell.
$ mongo

# Authenticate as the admin/root user.
> use admin
> db.auth("<admin OR root>", "<YOUR_MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD>")

# Create the user for the Datakit.
> db.createUser({
  "user": "datakit",
  "pwd": "<YOUR_COLLECT_PASSWORD>",
  "roles": [
    { role: "read", db: "admin" },
    { role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin" },
    { role: "backup", db: "admin" },
    { role: "read", db: "local" }
  ]
})
```

> For more permission details, refer to the official documentation [Built-In Roles](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/built-in-roles/){:target="_blank"}.

After executing the above commands, fill in the created "username" and "password" into the Datakit configuration file `conf.d/db/mongodb.conf`.

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "HOST Installation"

    Enter the `conf.d/db` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `mongodb.conf.sample`, and rename it to `mongodb.conf`. Example:

    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.mongodb]]
      ## Gathering interval
      interval = "10s"
    
      ## Specify one single Mongodb server. These server related fields will be ignored when the 'servers' field is not empty.
      ## connection_format is a string in the standard connection format (mongodb://) or SRV connection format (mongodb+srv://).
      connection_format = "mongodb://"
    
      ## The host and port. 
      host_port = "127.0.0.1:27017"
    
      ## Username
      username = "datakit"
    
      ## Password
      password = "<PASS>"
    
      ## The authentication database to use.
      # default_db = "admin"
    
      ## A query string that specifies connection specific options as <name>=<value> pairs.
      # query_string = "authSource=admin&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256"
    
      ## A list of Mongodb servers URL
      ## Note: must escape special characters in password before connect to Mongodb server, otherwise parse will failed.
      ## Form: "mongodb://[user ":" pass "@"] host [ ":" port]"
      ## Some examples:
      ## mongodb://user:pswd@localhost:27017/?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256&authSource=admin
      ## mongodb://user:pswd@127.0.0.1:27017,
      ## mongodb://10.10.3.33:18832,
      # servers = ["mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"]
    
      ## When true, collect replica set stats
      gather_replica_set_stats = false
    
      ## When true, collect cluster stats
      ## Note that the query that counts jumbo chunks triggers a COLLSCAN, which may have an impact on performance.
      gather_cluster_stats = false
    
      ## When true, collect per DATABASE stats
      gather_per_db_stats = true
    
      ## When true, collect per collection stats
      gather_per_col_stats = true
    
      ## List of dbs where collections stats are collected, If empty, all dbs are concerned.
      col_stats_dbs = []
    
      ## When true, collect top command stats.
      gather_top_stat = true
    
      ## Set true to enable election
      election = true
    
      ## TLS connection config
      # ca_certs = ["/etc/ssl/certs/mongod.cert.pem"]
      # cert = "/etc/ssl/certs/mongo.cert.pem"
      # cert_key = "/etc/ssl/certs/mongo.key.pem"
      # insecure_skip_verify = true
      # server_name = ""
    
      ## Mongodb log files and Grok Pipeline files configuration
      # [inputs.mongodb.log]
        # files = ["/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log"]
        # pipeline = "mongod.p"
    
      ## Customer tags, if set will be seen with every metric.
      # [inputs.mongodb.tags]
        # "key1" = "value1"
        # "key2" = "value2"
        # ...
    
    ```

    After configuration, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    Currently, you can enable the collector through [ConfigMap injection](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

### TLS Configuration (self-signed) {#tls}

Use `openssl` to generate certificate files for MongoDB TLS configuration, enabling server-side encryption and client authentication.

- Configure TLS certificates

Install `openssl` and run the following command:

```shell
sudo apt install openssl -y
```

- Configure MongoDB server-side encryption

Use `openssl` to generate certificate-level key files, run the following command and input the corresponding verification block information as prompted:

```shell
sudo openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:<bits> -days <days> -keyout <mongod.key.pem> -out <mongod.cert.pem> -nodes
```

- `bits`: RSA key bit size, for example 2048
- `days`: Expiration date
- `mongod.key.pem`: Key file
- `mongod.cert.pem`: CA certificate file

After running the above command, merge the `block` from both generated files by running the following command:

```shell
sudo bash -c "cat mongod.cert.pem mongod.key.pem >>mongod.pem"
```

After merging, configure the TLS sub-item in the `/etc/mongod.config` file

```yaml
# TLS config
net:
  tls:
    mode: requireTLS
    certificateKeyFile: </etc/ssl/mongod.pem>
```

Start MongoDB using the configuration file by running the following command:

```shell
mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf
```

Start MongoDB via the command line by running the following command:

```shell
mongod --tlsMode requireTLS --tlsCertificateKeyFile </etc/ssl/mongod.pem> --dbpath <.db/mongodb>
```

Copy `mongod.cert.pem` as `mongo.cert.pem` to the MongoDB client and enable TLS:

```shell
mongo --tls --host <mongod_url> --tlsCAFile </etc/ssl/mongo.cert.pem>
```

- Configure MongoDB client authentication

Use `openssl` to generate certificate-level key files, run the following command:

```shell
sudo openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:<bits> -days <days> -keyout <mongod.key.pem> -out <mongod.cert.pem> -nodes
```

- `bits`: RSA key bit size, for example 2048
- `days`: Expiration date
- `mongo.key.pem`: Key file
- `mongo.cert.pem`: CA certificate file

Merge `mongod.cert.pem` and `mongod.key.pem` files by running the following command:

```shell
sudo bash -c "cat mongod.cert.pem mongod.key.pem >>mongod.pem"
```

Copy the `mongod.cert.pem` file to the MongoDB server and configure the TLS item in the `/etc/mongod.config` file:

```yaml
# Tls config
net:
  tls:
    mode: requireTLS
    certificateKeyFile: </etc/ssl/mongod.pem>
    CAFile: </etc/ssl/mongod.cert.pem>
```

Start MongoDB by running the following command:

```shell
mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf
```

Copy `mongod.cert.pem` as `mongo.cert.pem`, copy `mongod.pem` as `mongo.pem` to the MongoDB client and enable TLS:

```shell
mongo --tls --host <mongod_url> --tlsCAFile </etc/ssl/mongo.cert.pem> --tlsCertificateKeyFile </etc/ssl/mongo.pem>
```

> Note: When using self-signed certificates, `insecure_skip_verify` in the `mongodb.conf` configuration must be `true`.

## Metrics {#metric}

All data collection below will append global election tag by default. You can also specify other tags via `[inputs.mongodb.tags]` in the configuration:

```toml
 [inputs.mongodb.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```

## Log Collection {#logging}

Uncomment `# enable_mongod_log = false` in the configuration file and change `false` to `true`. Other mongod log configuration options are under `[inputs.mongodb.log]`. The commented-out configurations are default settings. If the paths correspond correctly, no additional configuration is required. After starting Datakit, you will see a collected Metrics set named `mongod_log`.
