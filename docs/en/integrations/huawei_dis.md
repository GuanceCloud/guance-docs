Use the「Guance Cloud Synchronization」series script package in the script market to monitor the cloud ,The data of the cloud asset is synchronized to the observation cloud。


## Config {#config}

### Install Func

Recommend opening 「Integrations - Extension - DataFlux Func (Automata)」: All preconditions are installed automatically, Please continue with the script installation

If you deploy Func yourself,Refer to  [Self-Deployment of Func](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-integration/){:target="_blank"}


### Installation script

> Tip：Please prepare Huawei AK that meets the requirements in advance（For simplicity's sake, You can directly grant the global read-only permission`ReadOnlyAccess`）

To synchronize the monitoring data of  Huawei OBS cloud resources, we install the corresponding collection script：「观测云集成（华为云-DIS采集）」(ID：`guance_huaweicloud_dis`)

Click 【Install】 and enter the corresponding parameters: Huawei AK, Huawei account name.

tap【Deploy startup Script】, The system automatically creates `Startup` script sets, And automatically configure the corresponding startup script.

After the script is installed, Find the script in「Development」in Func「观测云集成（华为云-DIS采集）」, Expand to modify this script, find `collector_configs`and`monitor_configs`Edit the content in`region_projects`, Change the locale and Project ID to the actual locale and Project ID, Click Save Publish again.

In addition, the corresponding automatic trigger configuration is displayed in「Management / Crontab Config」. tap【Run】, It can be executed immediately once, without waiting for a periodic time. After a while, you can view task execution records and corresponding logs.

We collected some configurations by default, as described in the Metrics column [Configure custom cloud object metrics](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-huaweicloud-ces/){:target="_blank"}


### Verify

1. In「Management / Crontab Config」check whether the automatic triggering configuration exists for the corresponding task,In addition, you can view task records and logs to check whether exceptions exist
2. On the observation cloud platform, click 「Infrastructure / Custom」 to check whether asset information exists
3. On the observation cloud platform, press 「Metrics」 to check whether monitoring data exists

## Metric {#metric}
Configure Huawei Cloud - cloud monitoring. The default indicator set is as follows. You can collect more indicators by configuring them [Huawei CloudMonitor Metrics Details](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/usermanual-dis/dis_01_0131.html){:target="_blank"}
