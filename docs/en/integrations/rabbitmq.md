The RabbitMQ collector gathers data by using the `rabbitmq-management` plugin to monitor RabbitMQ. It can:

- Provide an overview of RabbitMQ, such as the number of connections, queues, total messages, etc.
- Track RabbitMQ queue information, such as queue size and consumer count.
- Track RabbitMQ node information, such as used `socket`, `mem`, etc.
- Track RabbitMQ exchange information, such as `message_publish_count`, etc.

## Configuration {#config}

### Prerequisites {#reqirement}

- RabbitMQ version >= `3.8.14`; tested versions:
    - [x] 3.11.x
    - [x] 3.10.x
    - [x] 3.9.x
    - [x] 3.8.x

- Install `rabbitmq` on `Ubuntu` for example

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
    sudo service rabbitmq-server start
    ```

- Enable `REST API plug-ins`

    ```shell
    sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
    ```

- Create a user, for example:

    ```shell
    sudo rabbitmqctl add_user guance <SECRET>
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions  -p / guance "^aliveness-test$" "^amq\.default$" ".*"
    sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags guance monitoring
    ```

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Host Installation"

    Navigate to the *conf.d/rabbitmq* directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `rabbitmq.conf.sample` and rename it to `rabbitmq.conf`. Example configuration:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.rabbitmq]]
      # rabbitmq url ,required
      url = "http://localhost:15672"
    
      # rabbitmq user, required
      username = "guest"
    
      # rabbitmq password, required
      password = "guest"
    
      # ##(optional) collection interval, default is 30s
      # interval = "30s"
    
      ## Optional TLS Config
      # tls_ca = "/xxx/ca.pem"
      # tls_cert = "/xxx/cert.cer"
      # tls_key = "/xxx/key.key"
      ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
      insecure_skip_verify = false
    
      ## Set true to enable election
      election = true
    
      # [inputs.rabbitmq.log]
      # files = []
      # #grok pipeline script path
      # pipeline = "rabbitmq.p"
    
      [inputs.rabbitmq.tags]
      # some_tag = "some_value"
      # more_tag = "some_other_value"
      # ...
    
    
    ```
    
    After configuring, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    Currently, you can enable the collector by injecting the collector configuration via [ConfigMap](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

## Metrics {#metric}

By default, all collected data will append global election tags, or you can specify other tags through `[inputs.rabbitmq.tags]` in the configuration:

``` toml
 [inputs.rabbitmq.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```

## Logging {#logging}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
???+ attention

    DataKit must be installed on the same host as RabbitMQ to collect RabbitMQ logs.
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

To collect RabbitMQ logs, you can enable the `files` section in *rabbitmq.conf* and specify the absolute path of the RabbitMQ log file. For example:

```toml
[[inputs.rabbitmq]]
  ...
  [inputs.rabbitmq.log]
    files = ["/var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit@your-hostname.log"]
```

After enabling log collection, the default log source (`source`) will be `rabbitmq`.

### Log Pipeline Field Splitting Explanation {#pipeline}

- General RabbitMQ Log Splitting

Example of a general log entry:

``` log

```
