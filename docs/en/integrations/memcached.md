The Memcached collector can collect instance runtime status metrics from Memcached instances and send the metrics to <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, helping with monitoring and analyzing various abnormal conditions of Memcached.

## Configuration {#config}

### Prerequisites {#requirements}

- Memcached version >= `1.5.0`. Tested versions:
    - [x] 1.5.x
    - [x] 1.6.x

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "HOST Installation"

    Navigate to the `conf.d/db` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `memcached.conf.sample`, and rename it as `memcached.conf`. Example:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.memcached]]
      ## Servers' addresses.
      servers = ["localhost:11211"]
      # unix_sockets = ["/var/run/memcached.sock"]
    
      ## Set true to enable election
      election = true
    
      ## Collect extra stats
      # extra_stats = ["slabs", "items"]
    
      ## Collect interval.
      # units: "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h"
      interval = "10s"
    
    [inputs.memcached.tags]
      # some_tag = "some_value"
      # more_tag = "some_other_value"
      # ...
    
    ```

    After configuration, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    You can currently enable the collector by injecting its configuration via [ConfigMap](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

## Metrics {#metric}

By default, all collected data will append global election tags, or you can specify other labels in the configuration through `[inputs.memcached.tags]`:

``` toml
 [inputs.memcached.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```
