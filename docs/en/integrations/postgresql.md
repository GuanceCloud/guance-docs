PostgreSQL collector can collect the running status index from PostgreSQL instance, and collect the index to Guance Cloud to help monitor and analyze various abnormal situations of PostgreSQL.

## Configuration {#config}

### Preconditions {#reqirement}

- PostgreSQL version >= 9.0
- Create user

```sql
-- PostgreSQL >= 10
create user datakit with password '<PASSWORD>';
grant pg_monitor to datakit;
grant SELECT ON pg_stat_database to datakit;

-- PostgreSQL < 10
create user datakit with password '<PASSWORD>';
grant SELECT ON pg_stat_database to datakit;
```

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Host Installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/db` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `postgresql.conf.sample` and name it `postgresql.conf`. Examples are as follows:

    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.postgresql]]
      ## Server address
      # URI format
      # postgres://[datakit[:PASSWORD]]@localhost[/dbname]?sslmode=[disable|verify-ca|verify-full]
      # or simple string
      # host=localhost user=pqgotest password=... sslmode=... dbname=app_production
    
      address = "postgres://datakit:PASSWORD@localhost?sslmode=disable"
    
      ## Ignore databases which are gathered. Do not use with 'databases' option.
      #
      # ignored_databases = ["db1"]
    
      ## Specify the list of the databases to be gathered. Do not use with the 'ignored_databases' option.
      #
      # databases = ["db1"]
    
      ## Specify the name used as the "server" tag.
      #
      # outputaddress = "db01"
    
      ## Collect interval
      # Time unit: "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h"
      #
      interval = "10s"
    
      ## Relations config
      # The list of relations/tables can be specified to track per-relation metrics. To collect relation
      # relation_name refer to the name of a relation, either relation_name or relation_regex must be set.
      # relation_regex is a regex rule, only takes effect when relation_name is not set.
      # schemas used for filtering, ignore this field when it is empty
      # relkind can be a list of the following options:
      #   r(ordinary table), i(index), S(sequence), t(TOAST table), p(partitioned table),
      #   m(materialized view), c(composite type), f(foreign table)
      #
      # [[inputs.postgresql.relations]]
      # relation_name = "<TABLE_NAME>"
      # relation_regex = "<TABLE_PATTERN>"
      # schemas = ["public"]
      # relkind = ["r", "p"]
    
      ## Set true to enable election
      election = true
    
      ## Run a custom SQL query and collect corresponding metrics.
      #
      # [[inputs.postgresql.custom_queries]]
      #   sql = '''
      #     select datname,numbackends,blks_read
      #     from pg_stat_database
      #     limit 10
      #   '''
      #   metric = "postgresql_custom_stat"
      #   tags = ["datname" ]
      #   fields = ["numbackends", "blks_read"]
    
      ## Log collection
      #
      # [inputs.postgresql.log]
      # files = []
      # pipeline = "postgresql.p"
    
      ## Custom tags
      #
      [inputs.postgresql.tags]
      # some_tag = "some_value"
      # more_tag = "some_other_value"
      # ...
    
    ```

    After configuration, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    The collector can now be turned on by [ConfigMap Injection Collector Configuration](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).

## Custom Object {#object}























































## Log Collection {#logging}

- PostgreSQL logs are output to `stderr` by default. To open file logs, configure them in postgresql's configuration file `/etc/postgresql/<VERSION>/main/postgresql.conf` as follows:

```toml
logging_collector = on    # Enable log writing to files

log_directory = 'pg_log'  # Set the file storage directory, absolute path or relative path (relative PGDATA)

log_filename = 'pg.log'   # Log file name
log_statement = 'all'     # Record all queries

#log_duration = on
log_line_prefix= '%m [%p] %d [%a] %u [%h] %c ' # æ¥å¿è¡åç¼
log_file_mode = 0644

# For Windows
#log_destination = 'eventlog'
```

For more configuration, please refer to the [doc](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-logging.html){:target="_blank"}ã

- The PostgreSQL collector does not have log collection enabled by default. You can open `files` in `conf.d/db/postgresql.conf`  and write to the absolute path of the PostgreSQL log file. For example:

```toml
[[inputs.postgresql]]

  ...

  [inputs.postgresql.log]
  files = ["/tmp/pgsql/postgresql.log"]
```

When log collection is turned on, a log with a log `source` of `postgresql` is generated by default.

**Notices:**

- Log collection only supports logs on hosts where DataKit is installed.

### Log Pipeline Cut {#pipeline}

The original log is

``` log
2021-05-31 15:23:45.110 CST [74305] test [pgAdmin 4 - DB:postgres] postgres [127.0.0.1] 60b48f01.12241 LOG:  statement:

## FAQ {#faq}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
### :material-chat-question: Missing metrics `postgresql_lock`, `postgresql_stat`, `postgresql_index`, `postgresql_size`, `postgresql_statio` {#faq-missing-relation-metrics}

To report these metrics, the `relations` field in the configuration file needs to be enabled. If some of these metrics are partially missing, it may be because there is no data for the relevant metrics.
