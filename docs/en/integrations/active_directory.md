# Active Directory
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

## Installation and Deployment {#config}

Note: The example version of [Active Directory exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter) is 0.24.0 (Windows)

### Enable DataKit Collector

- Enable the DataKit Prom plugin, copy the sample file

```cmd
cd C:\Program Files\datakit\conf.d\prom
# Copy prom.conf.sample as prom.conf
```

- Modify the `prom.conf` configuration file

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

??? quote "Configuration as follows"

    ```toml
    [[inputs.prom]]
    ## Exporter URLs
    urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:9182/metrics"]
    
    ## Ignore request errors for url
    ignore_req_err = false
    
    ## Collector alias
    source = "active_directory"
    
    ## Output source for collected data
    # Configure this item to write the collected data to a local file instead of sending it to the center
    # You can later debug the locally saved Measurement using the command `datakit --prom-conf /path/to/this/conf`
    # If the url has already been configured as a local file path, then the --prom-conf option will prioritize debugging the data in the output path
    # output = "/abs/path/to/file"
    > 
    ## Upper limit for the size of collected data, in bytes
    # Set an upper limit for the size of collected data when outputting it to a local file
    # If the size of the collected data exceeds this limit, the data will be discarded
    # The default upper limit for the size of collected data is set to 32MB
    # max_file_size = 0
    
    ## Metric type filtering, optional values are counter, gauge, histogram, summary
    # By default, only counter and gauge types of Metrics are collected
    # If empty, no filtering will be performed
    metric_types = ["counter", "gauge"]
    
    ## Metric name filtering
    # Supports regular expressions; multiple configurations can be made, satisfying any one of them is sufficient
    # If empty, no filtering will be performed
    # metric_name_filter = ["cpu"]
    
    ## Prefix for Measurement names
    # Configure this item to add a prefix to the Measurement name
    measurement_prefix = ""
    
    ## Measurement name
    # By default, the Metric name will be split by underscores "_", with the first field after the split becoming the Measurement name, and the remaining fields becoming the current Metric name
    # If measurement_name is configured, the Metric name will not be split
    # The final Measurement name will have the measurement_prefix added as a prefix
    # measurement_name = "prom"
    
    ## Collection interval "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"
    interval = "10s"
    
    ## Filter tags, multiple tags can be configured
    # Matching tags will be ignored
    # tags_ignore = ["xxxx"]
    
    ## TLS configuration
    tls_open = false
    # tls_ca = "/tmp/ca.crt"
    # tls_cert = "/tmp/peer.crt"
    # tls_key = "/tmp/peer.key"
    
    ## Custom authentication method, currently only supports Bearer Token
    # token and token_file: Only one of these needs to be configured
    # [inputs.prom.auth]
    # type = "bearer_token"
    # token = "xxxxxxxx"
    # token_file = "/tmp/token"
    
    ## Custom Measurement name
    # Metrics with a prefix can be grouped into one category of Measurements
    # Custom Measurement name configuration takes precedence over the measurement_name configuration item
    #[[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    #  prefix = "cpu_"
    #  name = "cpu"
    
    # [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    # prefix = "mem_"
    # name = "mem"
    
    ## Custom Tags
    [inputs.prom.tags]
      service = "active_directory"
    # more_tag = "some_other_value"
    ```
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

- Restart DataKit (If log collection needs to be enabled, configure log collection and then restart)

```bash
systemctl restart datakit
```

- DQL Verification

```bash
[root@df-solution-ecs-018 prom]# datakit -Q

Flag -Q deprecated, please use datakit help to use recommend flags.
