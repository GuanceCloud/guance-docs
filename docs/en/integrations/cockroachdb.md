The CockroachDB collector is used to collect metrics data related to CockroachDB, currently only supporting Prometheus format.

Tested versions:

- [x] CockroachDB 19.2
- [x] CockroachDB 20.2
- [x] CockroachDB 21.2
- [x] CockroachDB 22.2
- [x] CockroachDB 23.2.4

## Configuration {#config}

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Host Installation"

    Enter the `conf.d/db` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `cockroachdb.conf.sample` and rename it to `cockroachdb.conf`. Example configuration:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.prom]]
      ## Collector alias.
      source = "cockroachdb"
    
      ## Exporter URLs.
      urls = ["http://localhost:8080/_status/vars"]
    
      ## (Optional) Collect interval: (defaults to "30s").
      # interval = "30s"
    
      ## (Optional) Timeout: (defaults to "30s").
      # timeout = "30s"
    
      ## Stream Size. 
      ## The source stream segmentation size, (defaults to 1).
      ## 0 means the source stream is undivided. 
      stream_size = 0
    
      ## Unix Domain Socket URL. Using socket to request data when not empty.
      # uds_path = ""
    
      ## Ignore URL request errors.
      # ignore_req_err = false
    
      ## Collect data output.
      ## Fill this when you want to collect the data to a local file or center.
      ## After filling, you can use 'datakit debug --prom-conf /path/to/this/conf' to debug local storage measurement set.
      ## Use '--prom-conf' for debugging data in the 'output' path with higher priority.
      # output = "/abs/path/to/file"
    
      ## Collect data upper limit as bytes.
      ## Only available when setting output to a local file.
      ## If the collected data exceeds the limit, the data will be dropped.
      ## Default is 32MB.
      # max_file_size = 0
    
      ## Metrics type whitelist. Optional: counter, gauge, histogram, summary
      ## Example: metric_types = ["counter", "gauge"], only collect 'counter' and 'gauge'.
      ## Default collects all.
      # metric_types = []
    
      ## Metrics name whitelist.
      ## Regex supported. Multiple supported, conditions met when one matched.
      ## Collect all if empty.
      # metric_name_filter = ["cpu"]
    
      ## Metrics name blacklist.
      ## If a word is both in the blacklist and whitelist, the blacklist takes precedence.
      ## Regex supported. Multiple supported, conditions met when one matched.
      ## Collect all if empty.
      # metric_name_filter_ignore = ["foo","bar"]
    
      ## Measurement prefix.
      ## Add prefix to measurement set name.
      measurement_prefix = ""
    
      ## Measurement name.
      ## If measurement_name is empty, split the metric name by '_', the first field after splitting becomes the measurement set name, the rest become the current metric name.
      ## If measurement_name is not empty, use this as the measurement set name.
      ## Always add 'measurement_prefix' at the end.
      measurement_name = "cockroachdb"
    
      ## TLS configuration.
      # tls_open = false
      # tls_ca = "/tmp/ca.crt"
      # tls_cert = "/tmp/peer.crt"
      # tls_key = "/tmp/peer.key"
    
      ## Set to 'true' to enable election.
      election = true
    
      ## Disable setting host tag for this input.
      disable_host_tag = false
    
      ## Disable setting instance tag for this input.
      disable_instance_tag = false
    
      ## Disable info tag for this input.
      disable_info_tag = false
    
      ## Ignore tags. Multiple supported.
      ## The matched tags will be dropped, but the item will still be sent.
      # tags_ignore = ["xxxx"]
    
      ## Customize authentication. Currently supports Bearer Token only.
      ## Filling in 'token' or 'token_file' is acceptable.
      # [inputs.prom.auth]
        # type = "bearer_token"
        # token = "xxxxxxxx"
        # token_file = "/tmp/token"
    
      ## Customize measurement set name.
      ## Treat those metrics with a prefix as one set.
      ## Takes precedence over 'measurement_name' configuration.
      # [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
        # prefix = "sql_"
        # name = "cockroachdb_sql"
      
      # [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
        # prefix = "txn_"
        # name = "cockroachdb_txn"
    
      ## Do not collect these data when the tag matches.
      # [inputs.prom.ignore_tag_kv_match]
        # key1 = [ "val1.*", "val2.*"]
        # key2 = [ "val1.*", "val2.*"]
    
      ## Add HTTP headers to data pulling (Example basic authentication).
      # [inputs.prom.http_headers]
        # Authorization = "Basic bXl0b21jYXQ="
    
      ## Rename tag keys in prom data.
      [inputs.prom.tags_rename]
        overwrite_exist_tags = false
    
      # [inputs.prom.tags_rename.mapping]
        # tag1 = "new-name-1"
        # tag2 = "new-name-2"
    
      ## Send collected metrics to center as log.
      ## When the 'service' field is empty, use 'service tag' as the measurement set name.
      [inputs.prom.as_logging]
        enable = false
        service = "service_name"
    
      ## Customize tags.
      # [inputs.prom.tags]
        # some_tag = "some_value"
        # more_tag = "some_other_value"
    
    ```

    After configuring, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    You can inject the collector configuration via [ConfigMap method](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting) or configure ENV_DATAKIT_INPUTS to enable the collector.
