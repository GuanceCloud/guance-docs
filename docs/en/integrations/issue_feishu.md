## Configuration {#config}

### Prerequisites

You need administrative permissions for both the "Guance Workspace" and the "Lark Open Platform".

### Install Func

We recommend enabling the Guance integration - extension - DataFlux Func (Automata): all prerequisites are automatically installed. Please continue with the script installation.

If you deploy Func on your own, refer to [Self-deploy Func](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-integration/){:target="_blank"}

> We recommend deploying the GSE version.

### Install Script

In the script market, install the corresponding collection script: "Guance Integration (Guance Incident - Lark)" (ID: `guance_issue_feishu`) to enable it.

For easier maintenance of the documentation, please navigate to [Lark Integration Configuration](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-issue-feishu-integration/){:target="_blank"} for operation.
