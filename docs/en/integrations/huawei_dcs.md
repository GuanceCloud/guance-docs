Collect Huawei Cloud DCS Metrics data

## Configuration {#config}

### Install Func

It is recommended to enable Guance Integration - Extension - Managed Func: all prerequisites are automatically installed, please continue with the script installation.

If you deploy Func on your own, refer to [Self-deployed Func](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-integration/){:target="_blank"}

### Install Script

> Note: Prepare a Huawei Cloud AK that meets the requirements in advance (for simplicity, you can directly grant global read-only permission `ReadOnlyAccess`)

Synchronize the monitoring data of Huawei Cloud DCS by installing the corresponding collection scripts:

- **guance_huaweicloud_dcs**: Collects Huawei Cloud DCS Metrics data
- **guance_huaweicloud_dcs_slowlog**: Collects Huawei Cloud DCS slow log data

After clicking 【Install】, enter the corresponding parameters: Huawei Cloud AK, Huawei Cloud account name.

Click 【Deploy and Start Script】. The system will automatically create a `Startup` script set and configure the startup scripts accordingly.

After the script installation is complete, find the script "Guance Integration (Huawei Cloud-DCS Collection)" / "Guance Integration (Huawei Cloud-DCS Slow Query Log Collection)" under "Development" in Func, expand and modify the script. Edit the contents of `collector_configs` and `monitor_configs` under `region_projects`, change the region and Project ID to actual values, and then click Save and Publish.

Additionally, view the corresponding auto-trigger configuration under "Management / Auto-trigger Configuration". Click 【Execute】 to run it immediately without waiting for the scheduled time. After a short wait, you can view the task records and corresponding logs.

### Verification

1. Under "Management / Auto-trigger Configuration", confirm whether the corresponding task has an auto-trigger configuration. You can also check the task records and logs for any anomalies.
2. On the Guance platform, under "Infrastructure / Custom", check if there is asset information.
3. On the Guance platform, under "Metrics", check if there is corresponding monitoring data.
4. On the Guance platform, under "Logs", check if there is corresponding log data.

## Metrics {#metric}

Configure Huawei Cloud DCS monitoring metrics. More metrics can be collected through configuration [Huawei Cloud DCS Metrics Details](https://support.huaweicloud.com/usermanual-dcs/dcs-ug-0713011.html){:target="_blank"}
