# Huawei DCS
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

Use the「Guance Cloud Synchronization」series script package in the script market to monitor the cloud ,The data of the cloud asset is synchronized to the observation cloud。


## Config {#config}

### Install Func

Recommend opening 「Integrations - Extension - DataFlux Func (Automata)」: All preconditions are installed automatically, Please continue with the script installation

If you deploy Func yourself,Refer to  [Self-Deployment of Func](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-integration/){:target="_blank"}



### Installation script

> Tip：Please prepare Huawei AK that meets the requirements in advance（For simplicity's sake,，You can directly grant the global read-only permission`ReadOnlyAccess`）

To synchronize the monitoring data of  Huawei DCS cloud resources, we install the corresponding collection script：「观测云集成（华为云-DCS采集）」(ID：`guance_huaweicloud_dcs`)

After clicking "Install," enter the corresponding parameters: Huawei Cloud AK (Access Key) and Huawei Cloud account name.

Click "Deploy and Start Script," and the system will automatically create a `Startup` script set and configure the corresponding startup script.

In addition, in "Management / Automatic Trigger Configuration," you can see the corresponding automatic trigger configuration. Click "Execute" to run it immediately, without waiting for the scheduled time. After a short moment, you can check the execution task records and corresponding logs.

We have collected some default configurations. For details, please refer to the "Metrics" section: [Configure Custom Cloud Object Metrics](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-huaweicloud-ces/){:target="_blank"}.


### Verify

1. In「Management / Crontab Config」check whether the automatic triggering configuration exists for the corresponding task,In addition, you can view task records and logs to check whether exceptions exist
2. On the Guance platform, click 「Infrastructure / Custom」 to check whether asset information exists
3. On the Guance platform, press 「Metrics」 to check whether monitoring data exists

## Metric {#metric}
Configure Huawei Cloud - cloud monitoring. The default indicator set is as follows. You can collect more indicators by configuring them [Huawei CloudMonitor Metrics Details](https://support.huaweicloud.com/usermanual-dcs/dcs-ug-0713011.html){:target="_blank"}

### Redis Server Metrics of DCS Redis Instances

![img](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tghlinux/BlogImage/img/202308021139584.svg)NOTE:

- For Proxy Cluster instances, the monitoring covers Redis Servers and proxies. For Redis Cluster DCS Redis 4.0/5.0/6.0 instances and master/standby instances, the monitoring only covers Redis Servers.

Here is the translation of the provided field descriptions:

| Field                | Type    | Description                                                  |
| :------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ip`                 | String  | IP address used to connect to the cache instance. If it is a cluster instance, multiple IP addresses are returned, separated by commas. For example: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2. |
| `charging_mode`      | String  | Billing mode, where 0 indicates pay-as-you-go, and 1 indicates subscription. |
| `no_password_access` | String  | Indicates whether no password is required to access the cache instance: true: the instance does not require a password for access. false: the instance requires password authentication for access. |
| `enable_publicip`    | String  | Specifies whether Redis cache instance allows public network access. True: enabled; False: not enabled. |
| `max_memory`         | Integer | Total memory of the instance, measured in MB.                |
| `used_memory`        | Integer | Memory currently in use, measured in MB.                     |
| `capacity`           | Integer | Cache capacity in GigaBytes (GB).                            |
| `status`             | String  | CREATING: The cache instance is being created and is not yet in the running state. CREATEFAILED: The cache instance creation has failed. RUNNING: The cache instance is in normal running state. RESTARTING: The cache instance is undergoing a restart operation. FROZEN: The cache instance is in a frozen state. Users can renew the frozen cache instance in "My Orders". EXTENDING: The cache instance is in the process of being extended. RESTORING: The cache instance is currently restoring data. FLUSHING: The cache instance is currently clearing data. |

> *Note: Fields `tags` and `fields` might be subject to changes in future updates.*
>
> Tip 1: The value of `tags.name` is the instance ID, which serves as the unique identifier.
>
> Tip 2: All the following fields are JSON serialized strings - `fields.message` - `tags.az_codes`
