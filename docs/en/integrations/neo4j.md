Neo4j collector is used to collect metric data related to Neo4j, and currently it only supports data in Prometheus format. 

Already tested version:

- [x] Neo4j 5.11.0 enterprise
- [x] Neo4j 4.4.0 enterprise
- [x] Neo4j 3.4.0 enterprise
- [ ] Neo4j 3.3.0 enterprise this and versions earlier than this do not support
- [ ] Neo4j 5.11.0 community all community versions do not support

## Preconditions {#requirements}

- Install Neo4j server
  
See [official document](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/){:target="_blank"}

- Verify correct installation

  Visit URL in browser `<ip>:7474` can open Neo4j manage UI.

- Open Neo4j Prometheus port
  
  Search Neo4j start config file, usually `/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf`

  Add in the tail

  ```ini
  # Enable the Prometheus endpoint. Default is false.
  server.metrics.prometheus.enabled=true
  # The hostname and port to use as Prometheus endpoint.
  # A socket address is in the format <hostname>, <hostname>:<port>, or :<port>.
  # If missing, the port or hostname is acquired from server.default_listen_address.
  # The default is localhost:2004.
  server.metrics.prometheus.endpoint=0.0.0.0:2004
  ```

  See [official document](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/monitoring/metrics/expose/#_prometheus){:target="_blank"}
  
- Restart Neo4j

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
???+ tip

    - To collect data, port `2004` need to be used. When collecting data remotely, need to be opened.
    - 0.0.0.0:2004 If it is a local collection, need be localhost:2004.

=== "Host Installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/neo4j` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `neo4j.conf.sample` and name it `neo4j.conf`. Examples are as follows:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.neo4j]]
      ## Exporter URLs.
      urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:2004/metrics"]
    
      ## TLS configuration.
      tls_open = false
      # tls_ca = "/tmp/ca.crt"
      # tls_cert = "/tmp/peer.crt"
      # tls_key = "/tmp/peer.key"
    
      ## Set to 'true' to enable election.
      election = true
    
      ## disable setting host tag for this input
      disable_host_tag = false
    
      ## disable setting instance tag for this input
      disable_instance_tag = false
    
      ## Customize tags.
      # [inputs.neo4j.tags]
        # some_tag = "some_value"
        # more_tag = "some_other_value"
      
      ## (Optional) Collect interval: (defaults to "30s").
      # interval = "30s"
    
    ```

    Once configured, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    The collector can now be turned on by [ConfigMap Injection Collector Configuration](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).
