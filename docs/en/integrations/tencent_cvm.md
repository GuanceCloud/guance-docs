# Tencent Cloud CVM
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->
Use the "Watch Cloud Sync" script package in the script market to synchronize the data of the cloud monitoring cloud assets to the watch cloud


## Config {#config}

### Install Func

It is recommended to open Observation Cloud Integration-Extension-hosted Func: all preconditions are automatically installed, please continue with the script installation

If you want to deploy Func yourself refer to [deploy Func yourself](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-integration/){:target="_blank"}


### Install scripts

> Tip: Please prepare the required Ali Cloud AK in advance (for simplicity, you can directly grant global read-only permissions`ReadOnlyAccess`）

To synchronize the monitoring data of ECS cloud resources, we install the corresponding acquisition script:「观测云集成（腾讯云-CVM采集）」(ID：`guance_tencentcloud_cvm`)

After clicking 【Install】, input the corresponding parameters: Ali Cloud AK, Ali cloud account name.

Click to【Deploy startup Script】，It will be created automatically `Startup` script set, and automatically configure the corresponding startup script.

It can be opened in「Management / Crontab Config」to see the corresponding auto-trigger configuration in. Click to【Run】, can be executed immediately once, without waiting for a regular time. After a few moments, you can review the execution of the task and the corresponding log.

> If you want to collect the corresponding log, you also need to start the corresponding log collection script. If you want to collect a bill, start the cloud bill collection script.


We collect some configurations by default, as described in the metrics column.

[Configure custom cloud object metrics](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-tencentcloud-monitor/){:target="_blank"}


### Verification

1. Into「Management / Crontab Config」to confirm whether the corresponding task has the corresponding automatic trigger configuration, and you can view the corresponding task record and log to check whether there is an exception.
2. At the Guance cloud platform, at the「Infrastructure / Custom」to see if the asset information exists.
3. At the Guance cloud platform, at the「Metrics」check to see if there is any monitoring data.

## Metrics {#metric}
Configuring Tencent Cloud-cloud monitoring, the default indicator set is as follows, and more indicators can be collected through configuration [Tencent Cloud Monitor Metrics Details](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6843){:target="_blank"}
