# Incidents
---

## Overview

As another major fault management function, **Incident** is different from **[Event](../events/index.md)**, which can automatically send out alarm notification of abnormal events by obtaining exception log data in the current workspace. It supports any member in the workspace to define the observed abnormal phenomena as Issue, and locate the occurring abnormal problems in time and solve them effectively by manually creating and cooperating with members.


In this function module, you will learn about:
