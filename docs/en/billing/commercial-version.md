# Upgrade to Commercial Plan
---

For a comparison of the differences between the [Guance Free Plan and Commercial Plan](../plans/trail.md#trail-vs-commercial), Commercial Plan users support connecting larger volumes of data and can customize data retention periods more flexibly.

## Prerequisites

- Register for a [Guance Console](https://<<< custom_key.studio_main_site >>>/) account and use the Free Plan workspace.
- Register for a [Guance Billing Center](https://<<< custom_key.boss_domain >>>/) account to connect with subsequent billing functions.

## Upgrading from Free Plan to Commercial Plan

???+ warning "Upgrade Notice"

    - Once the Free Plan is successfully upgraded to the Commercial Plan, <u>it cannot be reverted</u>;
    - Collected data will continue to be reported to the Guance workspace, but <u>data collected during the Free Plan period will no longer be viewable</u>.

### Enter the Upgrade Page

Free Plan users of the workspace should log in to the console, go to **Billing**, click **Upgrade**, and enter the **Plan Upgrade** page.

### Select Settlement Method

After successfully upgrading from the Free Plan to the Commercial Plan, the default settlement method uses the Guance Billing Center account.

If you need to change the settlement method, you can click the **Bind Cloud Account** button. Currently, Guance supports [four settlement methods](./billing-account/index.md).

If you have not registered a cloud account, you can choose **Alibaba Cloud account**, **AWS Cloud account**, or **Huawei Cloud account** and select the settlement method as needed in the pop-up dialog box.

If you choose to use the Guance account for settlement, you can close the **Change Settlement Method** dialog box directly. You can also change the settlement method under **Workspace Management** in the Guance Billing Center.
