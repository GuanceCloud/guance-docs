# Workspace Management
---

Workspace is the basic operation unit of Guance SAAS products, and users can join one or more workspaces by creating/inviting. In a workspace, users can use the basic functions provided by Guance, such as scene data insight, event management, metric management, infrastructure monitoring, log monitoring, application performance monitoring, user access monitoring, availability monitoring, security check, monitoring, workspace management, etc.

In the Guance Expense Center, one account can bind multiple Guance workspaces. In "Manage Workspace", it is supported to view all workspaces bound under the account, and to modify the settlement methods of bound workspaces, including Guance expense center account, Amazon cloud account and Alibaba cloud account.

Note: The settlement method of workspace only supports changing once a month.

For more details, please refer to the doc [AWS account settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aws-account.md) and [Alibaba Cloud account settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aliyun-account.md).


### Change Settlement Method and Choose it at Will

By default, only "Guance Enterprise Account" and "Alibaba Cloud Account" can be selected for the workspace registered and logged in through "Alibaba Cloud Site", and only "Guance Enterprise Account" and "AWS Account" can be selected for the workspace registered and logged in through "AWS Site".
