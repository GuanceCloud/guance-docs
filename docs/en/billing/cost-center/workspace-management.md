# Workspace Management
---

Workspace is the basic operation unit of Guance SAAS products, and users can join one or more workspaces by creating/inviting. In a workspace, users can use the basic functions provided by Guance, such as scene data insight, event management, metric management, infrastructure monitoring, log monitoring, application performance monitoring, user access monitoring, availability monitoring, security check, monitoring, workspace management, etc.

In the Guance Expense Center, one account can bind multiple Guance workspaces. In **Manage Workspace**, it is supported to view all workspaces bound under the account, and to modify the settlement methods of bound workspaces, including Guance expense center account, Amazon cloud account and Alibaba cloud account.

Note: The settlement method of workspace only supports changing once a month.

### Guance Enterprise Account Settlement

Guance enterprise account is an independent account dedicated by Guance expense center to manage the billing related generated by using Guance products, and one expense center account can be associated with multiple workspace billing. See the doc [Guance enterprise account settlement](../../billing/billing-account/enterprise-account.md).


### Cloud Account Settlement

Cloud account settlement includes [AWS account settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aws-account.md) and [Alibaba Cloud account settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aliyun-account.md).


### Change and Choose Settlement Method

By default, only Guance Enterprise Account and Alibaba Cloud Account can be selected for the workspace registered and logged in through Alibaba Cloud Site, and only Guance Enterprise Account and AWS Account can be selected for the workspace registered and logged in through AWS Site. For more site selection, refer to the doc [choosing a registered site](../../getting-started/necessary-for-beginners/select-site.md).

If you need to change the settlement method arbitrarily, you need to open Select Settlement Method Arbitrarily. After opening, all users' workspaces in Guance can choose the settlement methods of Guance Enterprise Account, Alibaba Cloud Account and AWS Account at will.

> Note: To open **Arbitrary Selection of Settlement Method**, you need to contact the Guance account manager to make changes in the member management of Guance billing platform.

## Lock Workspace {#lock}

The following scenarios will trigger workspace locking:

- If the account number of the Guance Expense Center is used for settlement, the settlement will be carried out according to the billing cycle. After the bill is generated, the customer will be notified by email and a 14-day settlement cycle will be provided. If the settlement is not completed after 14 days, the associated workspace will be locked.
- The closure or expiration of an instance of [Alibaba Cloud marketplace subscription](../../billing/commercial-aliyun.md) will trigger the associated workspace lock if you use an Alibaba Cloud account for settlement.
- Cancellation or invalidation of items in [AWS cloud marketplace subscription](../../billing/billing-account/aws-account.md#subscribe) will trigger associated workspace locking if you use AWS account settlement.

After the workspace is locked, new data will stop being reported, and Guance provides a 14-day buffer period during which you can continue to view and analyze historical data, and continue to use Guance by unlocking the state.

### Unlock Workspace

On the **Workspace Management** page of the Guance Expense Center, select the workspace to be unlocked and click **Unlock**.

If the expense settlement is completed after changing the settlement method, the workspace can be unlocked and returned to normal.

- If settled by the Guance expense center, it will be settled according to the bill after the account is recharged. After settlement, the locked workspace will be unlocked.
- If settled by the cloud account, rebind the cloud account, re-subscribe to the related cloud account or select the Guance expense center for settlement, the locked related workspace will be unlocked automatically.
