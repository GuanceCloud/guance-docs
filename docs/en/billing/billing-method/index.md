# Billing Method
---


## Overview

When you open the business workspace of Guance and start using it, Guance provides a pay-as-you-go billing method. This article mainly introduces the detailed information of pay-as-you-go for Guance products, including [billing cycle](#cycle), [billing method](#account), [billing item](#item), [billing price](#price), [billing mode](#method) and [billing example](#example).

## Billing Cycle {#cycle}

The billing period of Guance is "days", that is, according to the statistical usage of the workspace on the same day, the daily bill is generated and synchronized to Guance [expense center](../../billing/cost-center/index.md), and finally the consumption amount is deducted from the corresponding account according to the actual binding settlement method.

## Settlement Method {#account}

Guance supports various settlement methods such as Guance enterprise account and cloud account. Cloud account settlement includes Alibaba Cloud account and AWS account settlement. In cloud account settlement mode, cloud bills from multiple sites are supported to be merged into one cloud account for settlement. Please refer to [Guance settlement method](../../billing/billing-account/index.md).

## Billing Item {#item}

All charging items of Guance are charged separately. For example, the log data you report will incur the cost of log storage, and the application performance link tracking data you report will incur the cost related to application performance Trace.

???+ attention

    - The statistical range of Guance billing items can be divided into "incremental statistics" and "full statistics", and the statistical range corresponding to different billing items is different. Please refer to [statistical range](#count) for detailed logic.
    
    - Guance metric data is charged according to the number of "timeseries". For detailed logic, please refer to [timeseries example](#time-example)
    
    - You can view the statistics of each billing item, historical billing, usage statistical trends and other information of the previous day in the Guance workspace payment plan and billing.

### Statistical Range {#count}

**Total Statistics**

In the current workspace, count the amount of all data within the current data storage policy as of now.

Note: Data storage policies for different types of data in Guance support custom selection. Please refer to [data storage policy](../../billing/billing-method/data-storage.md) for details.

**Incremental Statistic**

Under the current workspace, count the amount of data generated on that day.

### Billing Item Description

Detailed billing items for Guance are shown below, and the specific price is shown in [billing price](#price).

| Log data   | Per million     | 1.2 yuan       | 1.5 yuan | 2 yuan  | 2.5 yuan |

Note: The saving strategy of log data finally determines the unit price according to the saving strategy of log data.

#### AP Trace {#trace}

| **Billing Item**       | **Billing Unit** | **Gradient Price** |        |        |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Data storage strategy     |              | 3 days         | 7 days   | 14 days  |
| AP Trace   | Per million     | 2 yuan         | 3 yuan   | 6 yuan   |

#### User Access PV {#pv}

| **Billing Item**   | **Billing Unit** | **Gradient Price** |      |       |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---- | ----- |
| Data storage strategy |              | 3 days         | 7 days | 14 days |
| User access PV  | Every 10,000 articles    | 0.7 yuan       | 1 yuan | 2 yuan  |

## Billing Mode {#method}

Under SaaS billing-by-volume mode, users can freely choose the billing mode according to the characteristics of reported data.

### Default Billing Logic {#default}

Calculate the bill of the day according to the Billing Item listed above, and both DataKit and Timeseries are charged. In this mode, each DataKit will come with 300 free timeseries by default. Therefore, the actual timeseries quantity will be charged after deducting the free quantity. The calculation logic is as follows:

- Billing Timeseries Quantity = Timeseries Quantity-DataKit Quantity * 300
- Billing Timeseries Quantity Billing = (Timeseries Quantity-DataKit Quantity * 300)/1000 * Unit Price.

Note: If the calculated number of billing timeseries is less than 0, it will be calculated according to 0.

### Timeseries Only + Data Billing Logic {#time-data}

In this mode, DataKit does not charge, and there is no free timeseries logic. Except for DataKit and timeseries billing logic changes, other data Billing Item logic remains unchanged. The calculation logic is as follows:

- Billing Timeseries Quantity = Timeseries Quantity
- Billing Timeseries Quantity Billing = Timeseries Quantity/1000 * Unit Price


### Billing Logic {#gradient}

- Billing Item Bill = Billing Unit Quantity * Unit Price
- Billing Item Item Units = Actual Statistical Number / Billing Unit(Note: the result value is not carried here, and two decimal places of the value are reserved)

## Billing Sample {#example}

### Timeseries Number Measurement Example {#time-example}

**Basic Conceptual**

Metric data is composed of four parts: time, measurement, metrics and label. The timeseries number of a single measurement is equal to how many label combinations exist under the current measurement in a certain period of time. The number of timeseries in Guance workspace = the sum of timeseries of all measurement in the workspace.

**Timeseries of Statistical Measurements**

DataKit collects host and K8s cluster metric data generation timeseries estimation:

| Measurement   | Metrics                                               | Timeseries Estimation                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Host     | Single disk and single network card per host                             | About 20 ~ 30 timeseries                            |
| K8S cluster | 16 Node<br>300 POD<br>Meric data saving strategy: 14 days | About 6409 timeseries<br>![](../img/2.billing_1.png) |

You can also estimate your timeseries data based on the following example:

Suppose you collect the metric `http_response` from two hosts ( `host: A` and `host: B`) simultaneously to monitor application access. There are two labels here:

- `host`: Including `host: A` and `host: B` 
- `status_code`: Including `status_code: 200`, `status_code: 404` and `status_code: 500`

Suppose ` host: A ` has two requests that return status codes and ` host: B ` has three requests that return status codes, as shown in the following diagram:

<img src="../img/3.billing_time_1.png" width=800px />

According to the diagram above, the measurement  `http_response` will produce five timeseries.

```
 host: A ， status_code: 200 
 host: A ， status_code: 404 
 host: B ， status_code: 200 
 host: B ， status_code: 404 
 host: B ， status_code: 500 
```

**Label-based Timeseries of Change Statistics Measurement**

Based on the above schematic diagram, we add a label `url` to the measurement `http_response`, including two values `https://docs.guance.com/` and `https://www.guance.com/`, and then the measurement  `http_response` will produce 10 timeseries (i.e. 5*2=10).

```
 host: A ， status_code: 200 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/
 host: A ， status_code: 200 ， url: https://www.guance.com/
 host: A ， status_code: 404 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/
 host: A ， status_code: 404 ， url: https://www.guance.com/
 host: B ， status_code: 200 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/
 host: B ， status_code: 200 ， url: https://www.guance.com/
 host: B ， status_code: 404 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/
 host: B ， status_code: 404 ， url: https://www.guance.com/
 host: B ， status_code: 500 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/
 host: B ， status_code: 500 ， url: https://www.guance.com/
```

Based on the above example, we add a tag `host_ip` to the measurement `http_response`. Since the values of `host_ip` and `host` are one-to-one, the measurement `http_response` will not generate more timeseries, that is, although a tag attribute is added, only 10 timeseries will be generated.

```
 host: A ， status_code: 200 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.1
 host: A ， status_code: 200 ， url: https://www.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.1
 host: A ， status_code: 404 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.1
 host: A ， status_code: 404 ， url: https://www.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.1
 host: B ， status_code: 200 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.2
 host: B ， status_code: 200 ， url: https://www.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.2
 host: B ， status_code: 404 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.2
 host: B ， status_code: 404 ， url: https://www.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.2
 host: B ， status_code: 500 ， url: https://docs.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.2
 host: B ， status_code: 500 ， url: https://www.guance.com/ ， host_ip: 192.168.0.2
```

### Other Expense Related Examples

Suppose Company A uses Guance to observe the IT infrastructure and application systems of the company as a whole.

#### Example One

Suppose Company A has 10 hosts and produces 500 timeseries, 2 million log data, 2 million Trace data, 20,000 PV data and 20,000 task schedules every day. The data storage strategy used is as follows:

| Billing Item       | Metric (timeseries) | Log | AP Trace | User access PV |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Data storage strategy | 3 days           | 7 days | 3 days           | 3 days        |

Using [default billing logic](#default), the daily cost is 39.8 yuan, and the specific details are as follows:

| Billing Item   | Daily Billing Quantity | Billing Unit Price        | Billing Logic                                                     | Daily Billing Fee |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Host     | 10 sets      | 3 yuan / per host       | (Actual statistical quantity / Billing Unit) * unit price<br/>（10 / 1) * 3 yuan | 30 yuan      |
| Timeseries   | 500 articles     | 3 yuan / 1,000     | （number of timeseries - DataKit numbers * 300）/ 1000 * unit price<br>namely （500 - 10 * 300） / 1000 * 3 yuan | 0 yuan       |
| Log     | 2 million  | 1.2 yuan / million | (Actual statistical quantity / Billing Unit) * unit price<br>namely （2 million / 1 million） * 1.2 yuan | 2.4 yuan     |
| Trace    | 2 million   | 2 yuan / million个   | (Actual statistical quantity / Billing Unit) * unit price<br/>namely （2 million / 1 million） * 2 yuan | 4 yuan       |
| PV       | 20,000     | 0.7 yuan / 10,000   | (Actual statistical quantity / billing unit) * unit price<br/>namely （20,000 / 10,000） * 0.7 yuan | 1.4 yuan     |
| Task scheduling |20,000     | 1 yuan / 10,000     | (Actual statistical quantity / billing unit) * unit price<br/>namely （20,000 / 10,000） * 1 yuan | 2 yuan       |

Note: Because the timeseries is a full Billing Item, the change of the timeseries may lead to an increase in the number of timeseries and incur expenses. For more timeseries quantity measurements, please refer to the doc [timeseries example](#time-example).



#### Example Two

Suppose that Company A has a total of 10 hosts, generating 500 timeseries, 2 million log data, 2 million Trace data, 20,000 PV data and 20,000 task schedules every day. The data storage strategy used is as follows:

| Billing Item       | Metric (timeseries) | Log | AP Trace | User access PV |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Data storage strategy | 3 days           | 7 days | 3 days           | 3 days        |

Using [timeseries only + data billing logic](#time-data), the daily cost is 11.3 yuan, and the details are as follows:

| Billing Item   | Daily Billing Quantity | Billing Unit Price        | Billing Logic                                                     | Daily Billing Fee |
