# Advanced Functions


DQL queries support the selection of **advanced functions**. By using advanced functions, users can perform more in-depth analysis and processing of data according to their needs and expected outcomes.

Advanced functions are mainly used for further function calculations on data retrieved by DQL and provide intuitive time series chart displays. <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, in addition to providing official time series processing functions, supports reporting custom data processing functions via local Func. <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s time series charts support selecting custom functions for secondary data processing and returning processed data for display.


The central functions are continuously updated by <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s algorithm team. The current v1 version already supports the use of DBSCAN advanced functions. Click to learn more:
