| <div style="width: 200px">Use Cases</div> | Self-built Open Source | <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Building a cloud-era monitoring system** | A specialized technical team needs at least 3 months of investment, and that's just the beginning | Ready-to-use in 30 minutes |
| **Related cost investment** | Even for a simple open-source monitoring product, hardware investment is needed exceeding $3,000/year. If it’s an observability platform for the cloud era, there would be at least a fixed annual investment of $15,000 (estimated on cloud hardware) | Pay-as-you-go, according to actual business conditions, costs are flexible, overall costs are more than 50% lower than the comprehensive investment of using open-source products. |
| **System maintenance management** | Requires professional engineers to continuously focus and invest time; the mixed use of various open-source products also increases the complexity of management | No need to worry about it, focus your energy on business issues |
| **Number of probes to be installed on servers** | Each open-source software requires its own probe, consuming a large amount of server performance | One probe, fully based on binary operation, extremely low CPU and memory usage |
| **Value delivered** | Depends solely on the capabilities of the company’s engineers and their proficiency with open-source products | An all-around data-driven platform, full observability, allowing engineers to solve problems using data |
| **Root cause analysis of performance and faults** | Relies only on the team's own capabilities | Quickly locate based on data analysis |
| **Security** | Various mixed open-source software, testing the comprehensive skills of technical engineers | Comprehensive security scans and tests, customer-side code is open-sourced to users, and the product is updated in a timely manner to ensure security |
| **Scalability and services** | Needs to build its own SRE engineer team | Provides professional services, equivalent to configuring an external SRE support team |
| **Training and support** | Hiring external teachers | Long-term online training support |

From the table above, it can be seen that the investment a team makes to ensure the overall stability and reliability of the system may actually be quite significant, involving not just the cost of the software itself.

Although open-source software usually appears to require no monetary expenditure, the corresponding cloud service or physical server investments, time investments, and potential repeated investments due to changes in the technical team should also be considered.

Therefore, a team should adopt a more efficient way to ensure the development of its business rather than investing a large amount of resources in areas where they lack expertise. Professional matters should be handled and executed by professional services.


In fact, a team's investment in system assurance often exceeds 30%～50% of the overall cost of system construction and maintenance. This includes server resources consumed by various open-source probes, server investments required to deploy open-source software, as well as the corresponding investments in maintaining and monitoring systems. In addition, developers, testers, and operations engineers spend a great deal of effort handling how to determine various faults and anomalies, and **consume a lot of working time**. This does not include the business losses caused by system failures due to the lack of observability, which are all **hidden costs**. Teams that do not use powerful observability platforms often face the dilemma of incurring large hidden costs and wasting a lot of time.

<font color=coral>**Choosing <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> means that the technical team gains a very powerful observability product, significantly saving both explicit and hidden costs associated with system assurance, helping each team focus on their core business**.</font>
