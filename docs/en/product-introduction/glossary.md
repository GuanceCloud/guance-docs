Including components, features, clients, mobile applications, versions, billing, and other terminologies.

## Components

The components of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> include the frontend console Studio, data gateway DataWay, data collection agent DataKit, and the extensible programming platform Func.

| Component                                 | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Studio                               | Studio is the control panel of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, supporting comprehensive querying and analysis of collected data. |
| DataWay                              | DataWay is the data gateway of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, primarily used to receive data sent by DataKit and then report it to the DataFlux center for storage. |
| [DataKit](../datakit/index.md)       | DataKit is the real-time data collection agent of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, supporting hundreds of data collections. DataKit sends data to the DataWay data gateway first, which then reports it to the central system for storage and analysis. DataKit needs to be deployed in the user's own IT environment and supports multiple operating systems.<br/>Default collection frequency: 5 minutes |
| [Func](../dataflux-func/index.md) | Func, also known as DataFlux Func, is the extensible programming platform of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, used for function development, management, and execution. It is simple to use; you just write code and publish it, automatically generating an HTTP API interface for the function. Officially provided script libraries are ready-to-use, easily allowing <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> to call them. |

## Storage Engine Suite {#storage-suite}

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GuanceDB | Refers to the total set of storage engines developed by <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, including GuanceDB for metrics, GuanceDB for logs, and all sub-components within the suite. |
| GuanceDB for metrics | The time series metrics engine of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, specifically designed for storing and analyzing time series metrics data, including three components: guance-select, guance-insert, and guance-storage. |
| GuanceDB for logs | The non-time series data storage and analysis engine of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, suitable for log, APM, RUM, and event data, including guance-select, guance-insert, and the currently supported storage engine Doris. |
| guance-select | A sub-component of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s storage suite, responsible for querying and analyzing observable data. |
| guance-insert | A sub-component of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s storage suite, responsible for writing observable data. |
| guance-storage | The time series metrics data storage engine of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, responsible for storing time series metrics data. |

| [Scenarios](../scene/index.md)                                    | In scenarios, you can visualize collected data using charts. Currently, three display methods are supported: **Dashboards**, **Notes**, and **Explorers**.<br><li>[Dashboards](../scene/dashboard/index.md): Dashboards consist of multiple visual charts, used to view and analyze various related data simultaneously, obtaining comprehensive information with adjustable layout and chart sizes;<br/><li>[Notes](../scene/note.md): Notes combine text documents and visual charts, with a fixed layout from top to bottom. They allow for combined textual and graphical data analysis and reporting;<br/><li>[Explorers](../scene/explorer/index.md): Here, you can quickly build a log explorer, supporting customizable addition of statistical charts, setting default display attributes and filtering conditions, tailoring your log viewing needs.<br/><li>[Built-in Views](../scene/built-in-view/index.md): Includes two parts: **System Views** and **User Views**. System views are templates provided officially, while user views are created and saved by users as templates for use in scenarios and explorer details binding. |
| [Events](../events/index.md)                                   | Events are generated by monitors, intelligent inspections, SLOs, system operations, and Open API writes. They support real-time monitoring, unified querying, unresolved event statistics, and data export, allowing tracing of anomalies during specific time periods based on event data. |
| [Infrastructure](../infrastructure/index.md)                       | Physical infrastructure for data collection, currently supporting entities such as hosts, containers, processes, K8s, etc. |

Labels consist of label names and label values, and a data point can have multiple labels. For example, when collecting the `CPU Usage` metric, it will identify attributes like `host`, `os`, `product`, etc., collectively referred to as labels.<br/><li>[Time Series](../metrics/dictionary.md): In the current workspace, the number of all possible combinations based on labels in reported metric data. In <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, a time series is composed of metrics, labels (fields), and data storage duration, with "metrics" and "labels (fields)" forming the primary key for data storage. |
