## Observability

In the cloud-native era, enterprises adopt microservices, containers, Serverless, and other deployment methods while following changes in IT architecture and cloud-native technology practices. At the same time, they need to incorporate the perspectives of development and business departments while possessing capabilities broader and more proactive than traditional monitoring. This has led to traditional monitoring technologies and tools no longer meeting the requirements for complex IT systems in terms of controllability and stability.

In 2018, CNCF introduced the term <font color="coral">**"observability"**</font> into the IT field and stated that observability is a capability that must be possessed in the cloud-native era. Since then, "observability" has become one of the hottest topics in the cloud-native technology field. Subsequently, the CNCF published the [Observability White Paper](https://github.com/cncf/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper.md)
([:material-hand-pointing-right:Translated Chinese Version](https://github.com/chenmudu/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper-zh.md)), which provided a detailed introduction. The "three major signals of observability" mentioned therein—metrics (Metrics), logs (Logs), traces (Traces)—have also become common knowledge in the IT field.


## <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>

Based on predictions and firm beliefs about IT observability, our company began developing <font color="coral">**"the cloud-era system observability platform — <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>"**</font> as early as 2018. After five years of careful refinement by a professional team, <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> was officially launched on April 28, 2022.<br/>
After entering the market, <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> still maintains the update frequency of <font color="coral">**[“biweekly iteration”](../release-notes/index.md)**</font>, actively collecting feedback from users of different types, continuously expanding coverage across various technology stacks, optimizing user experience in product usage details, and enhancing the strong stability of public cloud and private platforms.

As a unified real-time monitoring application with observability capabilities, [<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>](https://<<< custom_key.brand_main_domain >>>/) can help users quickly achieve system observability, uniformly meeting monitoring needs related to cloud platforms, cloud-native applications, and businesses, building <u>full-chain observability</u> for every complete application. Moreover, <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> is not content with observability limited to the "three major signals of observability"; it also aims to help enterprises further pursue observability in "testing, pre-release, and production environments." Even more so, it effectively connects "development, testing, and operations teams" across the entire enterprise architecture, achieving enterprise-level <u>observability throughout the software development lifecycle</u>.


## Core Modules

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, as a platform for full-chain observability of application systems, can also be understood as a **powerful data analysis platform**. Corresponding to the flow of data in observability, the several core modules of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> are integrated throughout.
