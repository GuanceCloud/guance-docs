## Description

- Network security
- Mining risk
- Botnet risk


## Audit Method

- Verify if the host's sshd configuration file has been modified. You can run the following command to check:
```bash
ll /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```


## Remediation

- If the sshd configuration file has been modified, carefully inspect the host environment to determine if it has been compromised and change the host user passwords.
