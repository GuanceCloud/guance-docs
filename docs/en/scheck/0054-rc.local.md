# 0054-rc.local-rc.local File Modified
---

## Rule ID

- 0054-rc.local


## Category

- system


## Level

- warn


## Compatible Versions

- Linux


## Description

- Monitor the host startup loading files to check if they have been tampered with.


## Scan Frequency

- disable


## Theoretical Basis

- To add a program to the startup in Linux, it is usually done by modifying `rc.local`. However, there are typically two `rc.local` files in Linux: `/etc/rc.local` (a symbolic link) and `/etc/init.d/rc.local` (the actual file). By using MD5sum to calculate the MD5 checksum of the file and comparing the old and new checksums, we can detect if the file has been modified.


## Risk Items

- Hacker penetration
- Data leakage
- Network security
- Mining risk
- Botnet risk


## Audit Method

- Verify whether `/etc/rc.local` on the host has been illegally modified. You can use the following command to check:
```bash
md5sum /etc/rc.local
```


## Remediation

- If `/etc/rc.local` on the host has been illegally modified, carefully inspect the host environment for signs of intrusion and change the host user password.


## Impact

- Abnormal boot, starting abnormal processes, tampering with system environment variables, executing high-risk commands


## Default Value

- Inconsistent; modify according to the environment
