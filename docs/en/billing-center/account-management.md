## Cloud Account Management

A cloud account is the cloud account information saved after subscribing via a cloud provider. It can be used for settlement of new workspaces, meaning multiple workspaces can use the same cloud account for settlement. <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Center supports Amazon cloud accounts and Alibaba Cloud accounts. In **Account Management > Cloud Accounts**, you can view already subscribed cloud accounts and bind them to workspaces.

> For details on how to subscribe to cloud accounts, refer to the documentation [Alibaba Cloud Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aliyun-account.md), [AWS Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aws-account.md), and [Huawei Cloud Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/huaweicloud-account.md); 
>  
> For details on how to bind workspaces, refer to the documentation [Bind Workspace](../../billing/cost-center/workspace-management.md).
