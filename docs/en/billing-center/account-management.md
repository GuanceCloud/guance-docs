## Cloud Account Management

A cloud account is the cloud account information saved after subscribing to a cloud provider. It can be used for settling new workspaces, meaning multiple workspaces can settle using the same cloud account. The <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Center supports Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts and Alibaba Cloud accounts. In **Account Management > Cloud Accounts**, you can view subscribed cloud accounts and bind them to workspaces.

> For details on how to subscribe to cloud accounts, refer to the documentation [Alibaba Cloud Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aliyun-account.md), [AWS Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/aws-account.md), and [Huawei Cloud Account Settlement](../../billing/billing-account/huaweicloud-account.md);

> For details on how to bind workspaces, refer to the documentation [Bind Workspace](../../billing/cost-center/workspace-management.md).
