## 5.Choose a Workspace

On the Package Purchase page, select the workspace where you want to use the package. Multiple workspaces can be selected. If two workspaces are selected, the traffic of a single workspace will be given priority, the remaining traffic will be used for deduction in another workspace, and the traffic beyond the package will be charged according to the quantity.

For example, suppose you buy a start-up package for two workspaces A and B, the amount of log data is 150 million, and the daily usage of log data in workspaces A and B is 100 million each. The deduction method of the package is that Workspace A is fully deducted, Workspace B is deducted 50 million, and the remaining 50 million log data is charged according to the amount. Please refer to the doc [Package Description](../../../../billing/cost-center/account-wallet/yearly-package/index.md).<br />![](../../../img/1.package_5.png)
