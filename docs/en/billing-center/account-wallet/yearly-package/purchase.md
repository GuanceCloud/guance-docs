## 5. Select Workspace

On the package purchase page, choose the workspace where the plan package will be applied. Multiple workspaces can be selected. If two workspaces are chosen, the traffic will first satisfy the needs of one single workspace, and the remaining traffic will be used for the other workspace. Any traffic exceeding the package will be charged according to usage.

Example: Suppose you purchase the Startup Package for two workspaces A and B, with a log data quota of 150 million. Both workspaces A and B use 100 million logs per day. The offset method would completely cover workspace A's usage and offset 50 million logs from workspace B, leaving the remaining 50 million logs to be charged by volume. For detailed fee calculations, refer to the document [Plan Description](../../../../billing/cost-center/account-wallet/yearly-package/index.md).<br />![](../../../img/1.package_5.png)
