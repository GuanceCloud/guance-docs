# Synthetic Tests

---

Synthetic Tests is a comprehensive online service monitoring solution provided by <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>. It creates codeless APIs to simulate real user access experiences under different regional and network conditions using globally distributed monitoring points. This monitoring not only covers critical business scenarios such as network quality, website performance, and key endpoints but also provides periodic monitoring of multi-dimensional performance metrics including user experience.

Through the visual [data analysis platform](../scene/index.md) provided by <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, you can view and analyze monitoring data in real-time, gaining deep insights into service performance. <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> supports multi-dimensional real-time data analysis, helping users fully understand service availability. Additionally, by setting up [alert mechanisms](../monitoring/alert-setting.md), you can detect anomalies in key performance indicators, ensuring timely responses when issues arise, maintaining business stability and continuity.

## Use Cases

- Multi-protocol Support: Create Test tasks based on HTTP, TCP, ICMP, WEBSOCKET protocols to actively monitor the availability and performance of online services from multiple aspects;
- Global Network Monitoring: Utilize <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s globally distributed monitoring points to instantly monitor network performance, ensuring global service availability and performance;
- Website Performance Analysis: Analyze the availability performance of websites from geographical and availability trend perspectives;
- Real-time Alert Notifications: Configure alert rules based on data generated by Test tasks. When business anomalies occur, alerts are sent via methods such as email and DingTalk bots as described in [notification targets](../monitoring/notify-object.md).

## Getting Started

- Custom Test Tasks: Create Test tasks based on `HTTP`, `TCP`, `ICMP`, `WEBSOCKET` protocols to monitor your site's operational quality anytime, anywhere.
- Overview: Analyze application performance from geographical and trend dimensions for specified Test tasks, including response time, round-trip time, connection time, and availability rate.
- Explorer: View all detailed data returned by Test tasks, including DNS, SSL, TTFB performance test results, request errors, page load performance, etc.
- User-defined Nodes: <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> has already covered multiple probing nodes globally, and it also supports creating nodes based on different geographic locations and cloud providers, maximizing system availability.
- Synthetic Testing Anomaly Detection: Monitor Synthetic Testing data within the workspace in conjunction with [monitoring](../monitoring/index.md) features.
