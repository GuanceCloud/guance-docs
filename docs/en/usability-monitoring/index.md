## Overview

Guance provides an out-of-the-box availability monitoring solution. You can build your own dialing tasks based on `HTTP、TCP、ICMP、WEBSOCKET` protocols, periodically detect the availability of network sites and comprehensively monitor the network performance, network quality and network data transmission stability from different regions and different dialing nodes to various services.

Guance also provides you with dialing test task log. With our [visual data analysis](../scene/index.md) and [event alarm capability](../monitoring/index.md), you can monitor and count the usability of dialing test tasks in real time, and discover the performance problems and affect areas of network sites before users.

## Application Scene

- Web site access performance analysis: Analyze the usability performance of Web sites from two aspects of geographical latitude and usability trend.
- [Real-time monitoring and alarm](../monitoring/index.md): Configure the alarm based on the data generated by the dialing task, and inform the notified person by mail and nailing robot.
  
## Feature Introduction

- **Custom test task**: Support to create test tasks based on `HTTP、TCP、ICMP、WEBSOCKET` protocol to monitor your site running quality anytime and anywhere.
- **Overview**: Analyze the application performance of the target site under the specified dial-up task from two dimensions of geography and trend, including response time, round-trip time, connection time and usability rate.
- **Observer**: View all data details returned by dialing test tasks, including performance test results such as DNS, SSL, TTFB, request errors and page loading performance.
- **Self-built detection nodes**: Guance has covered 16 detection nodes all over the world, and supports you to build your own nodes based on different geographical locations and different cloud operators to give full play to the usability of the system.
- **Usability monitoring data detection**: Monitor availability monitoring data in the workspace in conjunction with the [monitor](../monitoring/index.md).

## Description of Steps

- **Step 1**: Go to "Task" of "Usability Monitoring", click "New Task" to create dialing test tasks based on HTTP, TCP, ICMP and WEBSOCKET protocols and "Save".
- **Step 2**: View all usability data that exists in the current workspace through the Observer.
- **Step 3**: Through the "Overview", the usability and response time of sites are analyzed from multiple dimensions such as region, city and operator.
- **Step 4**: Monitor usability monitoring data in the workspace through "Monitor"-"Monitor"-"Usability Monitoring Data Detection."
