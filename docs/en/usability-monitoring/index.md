# Synthetic Tests
---

## Overview

Guance provides an out-of-the-box synthetic tests solution. You can build your own tasks based on `HTTP`, `TCP`, `ICMP`, `WEBSOCKET` protocols, periodically detect the availability of network sites and comprehensively monitor the network performance, network quality and network data transmission stability from different regions and different dialing nodes to various services.

Guance also provides you with task log. With our [visual data analysis](../scene/index.md) and [event alarm capability](../monitoring/index.md), you can monitor and count the usability of tasks in real time, and discover the performance problems and affect areas of network sites before in advance.

## Application Cases

- Web site access performance analysis: Analyze the usability performance of Web sites from two aspects of geographical latitude and usability trend.
- [Real-time monitoring and alarm](../monitoring/index.md): Configure the alarm based on the data generated by the task, and inform the notified person by mail and Dingtalk robot.
  
## Features

- **Custom task**: Support to create tasks based on `HTTP`, `TCP`, `ICMP`, `WEBSOCKET` protocols to monitor your site running quality anytime and anywhere.
- **Overview**: Analyze the application performance of the target site under the specified task from two dimensions of geography and trend, including response time, round-trip time, connection time and usability rate.
- **Explorers**: View all data details returned by tasks, including performance test results such as DNS, SSL, TTFB, request errors and page loading performance.
- **Self-built detection nodes**: Guance has covered 16 detection nodes all over the world, and supports you to build your own nodes based on different geographical locations and different cloud operators to give full play to the usability of the system.
- **Synthetic Tests data detection**: Monitor synthetic tests data in the workspace in conjunction with the [monitor](../monitoring/index.md).

## Setup

- **Step 1**: Go to "Task" of "Synthetic Tests", click "New Task" to create tasks based on HTTP, TCP, ICMP and WEBSOCKET protocols and "Save".
- **Step 2**: View all usability data that exists in the current workspace through the Explorers.
- **Step 3**: Through the "Overview", the usability and response time of sites are analyzed from multiple dimensions such as region, city and operator.
- **Step 4**: Monitor synthetic tests data in the workspace through "Monitor"-"Synthetic Tests Data Detection".
