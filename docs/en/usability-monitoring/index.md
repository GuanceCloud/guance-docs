# Synthetic Tests
---

Synthetic Tests is the comprehensive online service monitoring solution provided by <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>. It creates API tests without requiring code writing, using globally distributed monitoring points to simulate real users' access experiences under different regional and network environments. This monitoring not only covers key business scenarios such as network quality, website performance, and critical endpoints but also provides periodic monitoring of multi-dimensional performance Metrics including user experience.

Through the visual [data analysis platform](../scene/index.md) provided by <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, you can view and analyze monitoring data in real-time to gain a deeper understanding of service performance status. <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> supports multi-dimensional real-time data analysis, helping users fully grasp the availability of their services. At the same time, by setting up [alert mechanisms](../monitoring/alert-setting.md), you can perform anomaly detection on key performance Metrics, ensuring timely responses when issues arise, thus maintaining business stability and continuity.

## Use Cases

- Multi-protocol support: Create TESTING tasks based on HTTP, TCP, ICMP, WEBSOCKET protocols for multi-faceted active monitoring of online service availability and performance;
- Global network monitoring: Using <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>â€™s globally distributed monitoring points, instantly monitor network performance to ensure global service availability and performance;
- Network site access performance analysis: Analyze the availability performance of network sites from geographical and availability trend perspectives;  
- Real-time alert notifications: Configure alert rules based on data generated by TESTING tasks. When business anomalies occur, alerts will be sent via [email, DingTalk bots, etc.](../monitoring/notify-target.md).

## Getting Started

- Custom TESTING tasks: Create TESTING tasks based on `HTTP`, `TCP`, `ICMP`, `WEBSOCKET` protocols to monitor your site's operational quality anytime and anywhere.
- Overview: Analyze application performance of target sites specified in TESTING tasks from geographical and trend dimensions, including response time, round-trip time, connection time, and availability rate.
- Explorer: View all detailed data returned by TESTING tasks, including DNS, SSL, TTFB performance test results, request errors, page load performance, etc.
- Self-built testing nodes: <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> already covers multiple testing nodes globally. Additionally, it supports you creating nodes based on different geographical locations and cloud providers to maximize system availability.
- Synthetic Testing Anomaly Detection: Monitor Synthetic Testing data within the workspace in conjunction with [Monitoring](../monitoring/index.md) functionality.
