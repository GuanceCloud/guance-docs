# Dial Task
---

## Introduction

Guance supports custom dialing tasks. By creating dialing test tasks based on different protocols such as `HTTP、TCP、ICMP、WEBSOCKET`, the network performance, network quality and network data transmission stability of different regions and different operators to various services are comprehensively monitored.

## Explanation of Nouns

- **HTTP protocol:** Hypertext transfer protocol, an application layer protocol based on TCP/IP for distributed, cooperative and hypermedia information systems, is the foundation of data communication. Typically, an HTTP client initiates a request to create a TCP connection to the specified port of the server (the default is Port 80). The HTTP server listens on that port for client requests. Once the request is received, the server returns a status to the client, such as `"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`, along with the content returned, such as the requested file, error message or other information.

- **TCP protocol:** Transmission control protocol, a network communication protocol that specifies how to establish and maintain a connection in which two programs can exchange data and how to send information over the Internet. Typically, TCP breaks a message or file into smaller pieces (packets) that are sent over the Internet and received by another TCP layer, and reassembles the data into a complete file or message. At the same time, TCP carries out error checking on the data stream. If an error is found, TCP retransmits the data packet to ensure the transmission of the data.

- **ICMP protocol:** Internet control message protocol, a sub-protocol of the TCP/IP suite, used to transfer control messages between IP hosts and routers. Control messages refer to network messages such as whether the network is unobstructed, whether the host is reachable, whether the route is available, etc., which play an important role in the transmission of user data.

- **WEBSOCKET protocol:** A network communication protocol, HTML5 began to provide a browser and server full dual communication network technology. WebSocket carries out message transmission based on TCP bidirectional full duplex. At the same time, it can send or accept messages. The server can actively send messages to the client, and the client can actively send messages to the server.

## Create A Dial Test Task

In the Guance workspace "Usability Monitoring"-"New", you can create dial test tasks, including HTTP protocol, TCP protocol, ICMP protocol, WEBSOCKET protocol and other options.

**Note:**

- Standard members and above can create dialing test tasks;
- The free workspace can create up to 5 dialing tasks, and only supports the use of "China" dialing nodes. If you need to create more dialing tasks or use more overseas dialing nodes, please go to the "Billing" page in the workspace to upgrade.

## Start/Stop Dial Test Task

After creating the dialing test task, the dialing test task is "started" by default, and you can view the data generated by the task by clicking the task "name" in the "Usability Monitoring" task list. At the same time, you can do the following,

- "Stop" dialing task
- "Edit" dialing test task
- "Delete" dialing test task

## More Advanced Configurations

Guance supports the rapid establishment of private deployment nodes distributed all over the world through "self-built node management". For operation details, please refer to [self-built node management](../self-node.md), and for specific deployment documents, please refer to [network dial test](../../integrations/network/dialtesting.md).
