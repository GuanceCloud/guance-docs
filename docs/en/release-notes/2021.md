This document records the update content description of each online release of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, including DataKit, <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> best practices, <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> integration documentation, and <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>.

## December 30, 2021

#### Optimization of binding built-in views

"<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>" supports associating built-in views with different link services, applications, log sources, projects, etc., by binding fields. According to the bound fields, you can view the associated built-in views (system views, user views) on the corresponding Explorer detail pages. Supported Explorers include custom scene Explorers, infrastructure, logs, links, user access, security checks, availability, etc.


#### Optimization of log Explorer

- In the log Explorer, the left source list is expanded by default when logging in for the first time and can be manually collapsed. The Explorer will remember the last state by default.
- In the log Explorer, click the settings button on the left to manually add filter fields for quick filtering.
- In the log data list, you can use "hovering the mouse" over the log content to expand and view all the log content. Clicking the "copy" button copies the entire log content to the clipboard. When expanding, if possible, the system will format the log JSON; otherwise, it displays the log content normally.



#### Optimization of associated display on Explorer detail pages

The associated display on the log, infrastructure, link, security check Explorer detail pages has been optimized. This includes associated queries for hosts, metrics, links, containers, logs, Pods, etc. Two types of associated displays are supported: fixed display and non-fixed display (which requires displaying based on whether the associated field is included).

Take the log Explorer detail page's associated host as an example. The associated fields are "host", and in the log details, you need to match the "host" field to view related hosts; otherwise, you cannot see the related host page in the log details. After matching the fields, you can view the basic information and metric performance status of the host under the associated host.

- Attribute view: includes basic host information, integration operation status. If cloud host collection is enabled, you can also view cloud vendor information.



- Metric view: You can view the performance metric views of related hosts within the default 15 minutes. Click "Open this view" to go to the built-in view, where you can customize and modify the host view via cloning and save it as a user view. The user view can be viewed by binding it on the log detail page.



#### Optimization of snapshot sharing

Snapshot sharing supports hiding the top bar of the shared page. In the snapshot list, click the share button, and in the pop-up dialog box, you can set advanced options like "hide the top bar".



#### Optimization of chart query result showing thousand separators

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> dashboard chart query results support automatically adding thousand separators to the data display. If a unit is set, the data format will follow the set unit, and after setting, you can preview the result.



#### Other optimization features

- Optimized performance of the host network topology diagram query, added target domain name display in the network topology diagram node. That is, if the target host is not in the current workspace but the target domain name exists and the port of the target domain name is less than 10000, then the target domain name will be displayed in the topology diagram.
- Optimized logic for pinning favorite dashboards and notes:
   - Unfavorited dashboards are sorted in reverse order of creation time
   - Favorited dashboards are sorted in reverse order of favoriting time
   - Favorited dashboards are displayed above unfavorited dashboards
- Optimized cascading query logic for view variables, i.e., when two variables are linked, selecting `*` in the previous one does not filter the linked variable, showing all value options.
- Added help documentation links to the collapsed navigation bar on the left.
## December 16, 2021

#### New similarity metric query for time series charts

Additionally, a "delete" button has been added on the right side of the Explorer search bar to support one-click deletion of entered text.


#### Optimization of log Explorer and log-related data query

- Through the "container" below the log details page in "<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>", you can view all container (CONTAINERS) data related to the log's host within the last ten minutes.
- Logs related to trace and container data support filtering by "trace_id" or "host".
- Log details content supports two viewing modes: Json and text, automatically displaying format based on the message type.
- Through approximate text Explorer, you can view the details of associated logs after Pattern clustering.
- Hover tips for log Explorer have removed colors.


#### Optimization of silence strategy, supporting setting silence for monitoring rules

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> allows users to manage all silence rules for the current space through "Silence Management" in the "Monitoring" feature. "<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>" provides three types of silences: host silence, monitor silence, and group silence, supporting silence management for different hosts, monitors, and groups, ensuring that silent objects do not send alarm notifications to any notification targets during the silence period.
