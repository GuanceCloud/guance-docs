![](img/6.log_12.png)

#### Optimized Associated Display on Explorer Detail Pages

The associated display on detail pages of log, infrastructure, trace, Security Check Explorers has been optimized, including host, Metrics, trace, container, Pod, etc. It supports two types of associated displays: fixed display and non-fixed display (which requires displaying associated queries based on whether they contain associated fields).

Taking the Log Explorer detail page as an example, the associated field is "host". To view related hosts in log details, the "host" field needs to match; otherwise, you cannot view related host pages in log details. After field matching, you can view basic information and performance status of the host under associated hosts.

- Attribute View: Includes basic host information, integration operation status, and cloud provider information if cloud host collection is enabled.

![](img/7.host_1.png)

- Metrics View: You can view the CPU, memory, and other performance metrics of the related host within the default 15 minutes.
