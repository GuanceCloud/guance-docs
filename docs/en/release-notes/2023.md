### Intelligent Inspection Updates

- New Inspections

    - Cloud Idle Resource Inspection: With the rapid development of cloud computing as a new IT service method, it provides convenient, fast, and elastic IT infrastructure and application services for enterprises and individuals, bringing high efficiency and economy. However, as cloud resources gradually become the main component of enterprise data centers, the issue of significant waste of cloud resources becomes more prominent. Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and departmental isolation, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming a large number of idle resources. This situation can significantly increase cloud service costs, decrease resource efficiency, and potentially lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize cloud idle resources, improving cloud computing benefits and resource utilization, performing cloud idle resource inspections is essential. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in current cloud services can be discovered and handled promptly, avoiding unnecessary expenses, data breaches, poor performance, and other issues caused by long-term unnecessary resource usage.

    - Host Restart Inspection: Host abnormal restart monitoring is an important part of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When hosts encounter abnormal restarts, it can lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss, affecting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts and rising system complexity in cloud and virtualization environments, the probability of issues increases, requiring system administrators to use relevant monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal restarts. Therefore, implementing reasonable host abnormal restart monitoring can help diagnose problems quickly, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.

- Function Optimization

    - Idle Host Inspection: Added cost-related information for cloud host types.

Refer to the **Permission Change Review** documentation for more details.

#### Added Login Session Persistence Time Setting

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> supports setting session persistence time for accounts logging into workspaces, including SSO single sign-on accounts and workspace-registered accounts, supporting setting "No Operation Login Session Persistence Time" and "Maximum Login Session Persistence Time", settings after which timeout login sessions will expire.

- No Operation Login Session Persistence Time: Supports setting range 30 ~ 1440 minutes, default 30 minutes;
- Maximum Login Session Persistence Time: Supports setting range 0 ~ 7 days, where 0 means never timeout, default 7 days.

#### Added Ticket Management

For issues encountered in <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, users can submit tickets for consultation and suggestions, and the official team will handle and respond promptly. For example: difficult-to-resolve issues during use, inquiries about purchases and fees, proposing demand suggestions to <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, etc.

#### Other Function Optimizations

- Workspace creation added language selection, language options affect event, alert, SMS templates within the workspace. If English is chosen, the above corresponding templates will default to English templates;
- Optimized workspace lock function, if the fee center account is overdue or cloud market subscription is abnormal, it leads to workspace locking. After workspace locking, new data reporting stops, <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> provides a 14-day buffer period during which historical data can still be viewed and analyzed, and unlocking can resume <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> usage. Refer to the **Workspace Lock** documentation for more details.

### Intelligent Inspection Updates

#### New Inspections

- **RUM Performance Inspection:** Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an application performance monitoring technology aimed at evaluating website performance by simulating real-user behavior on browsing websites. RUM aims to understand website performance from the user's perspective, such as load time, page rendering, element loading, and interaction response. RUM performance inspection is mainly used for client-side websites, such as e-commerce, financial, entertainment websites, etc., which require presenting a fast and smooth user experience. Analyzing RUM performance results can help developers quickly understand the actual user experience and rapidly improve website performance.
- **Kubernetes Health Inspection:** Nowadays, Kubernetes has swept the container ecosystem, serving as the brain for distributed container deployments, managing service-oriented applications. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updates, service discovery, and scaling. However, how to ensure the health of Kubernetes nodes? Intelligent inspections can retrieve and detect resource states, APM, service fault logs, etc., to accelerate event investigation, reduce engineer pressure, minimize average repair time, and improve end-user experience.

Refer to the **Intelligent Inspection Update Log** for more intelligent inspection updates.
