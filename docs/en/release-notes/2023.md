### Intelligent Inspection Update

- Added Inspections

    - Idle Cloud Resources Inspection: As cloud computing develops rapidly as a completely new IT service method, it provides convenience, speed, flexibility in IT infrastructure and application services for enterprises and individuals, bringing high efficiency and economy. However, as cloud resources gradually become the main component of enterprise data centers, the enormous waste of cloud resources has become increasingly significant. Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and isolation between departments, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming a large number of idle resources. This situation causes the cost of cloud service for enterprises to rise straight up, reduces resource efficiency, and may even lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize idle cloud resources, enhancing the use benefits and resource utilization rate of cloud computing, conducting idle cloud resource inspections is very necessary. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in the current cloud service can be discovered and handled promptly, avoiding unnecessary costs, data leaks, poor performance, etc., caused by long-term use of unnecessary resources.

    - Host Restart Inspection: Host abnormal restart monitoring is an important part of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When hosts encounter abnormal restarts, risks such as system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss arise, affecting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, the complexity of the system increases, leading to higher probabilities of problems occurring, necessitating system administrators to use relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal restarts. Therefore, reasonably implementing host abnormal restart monitoring helps businesses quickly diagnose problems, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.

- Functional Optimization

    - Idle Host Inspection: Added cost-related information for cloud host types.

### Intelligent Inspection Update

#### Added Inspections

- **RUM Performance Inspection:** Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an application performance monitoring technology aimed at evaluating website performance by simulating real user browsing behavior. The purpose of RUM is to understand website performance from the user's perspective, understanding website load times, webpage presentation effects, loading situations of page elements, and interaction response times. The primary use case for RUM performance inspections is client-type websites, such as e-commerce websites, financial websites, entertainment websites, etc., these websites all need to present users with fast and smooth access experiences. Through analyzing RUM performance results, developers can quickly understand users' actual experiences to promptly improve website performance.
- **Kubernetes Health Inspection:** Nowadays Kubernetes has swept across the entire container ecosystem, acting as the brain for distributed container deployments, aiming to manage service-oriented applications using containers distributed across host clusters. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updates, service discovery, and scaling, but how do we ensure the health of Kubernetes nodes? Through intelligent inspections, it can retrieve and discover problems based on the resource states, application performance management, and service failure logs of current nodes, thus accelerating event investigations, relieving engineers' pressure, reducing mean time to repair, and improving end-user experience.
