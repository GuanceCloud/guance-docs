### Intelligent Inspection Update

- Added Inspections

    - **Idle Cloud Resource Inspection**: Cloud computing has rapidly developed as a new IT service model, providing convenient, fast, and elastic IT infrastructure and application services for enterprises and individuals, bringing high efficiency and economic benefits. However, with cloud resources becoming the main component of enterprise data centers, the enormous waste of cloud resources becomes increasingly significant. Especially within enterprises, due to demand fluctuations and departmental isolation, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, forming large amounts of idle resources. This situation causes enterprise cloud service costs to rise sharply, decreases resource efficiency, and may lower security and performance levels. To better manage and optimize idle cloud resources, enhancing the use benefits and resource utilization rate of cloud computing, performing idle cloud resource inspections is very necessary. Through inspections, unnecessary resources in current cloud services can be discovered and handled promptly, avoiding unnecessary expenses, data leaks, poor performance, and other issues caused by long-term use.

    - **Host Restart Inspection**: Host abnormal restart monitoring is an important aspect of modern internet system operations. On one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for smooth business operations and user experience. When a host experiences abnormal restarts, it can lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss risks, affecting business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, system complexity increases, raising the probability of issues occurring. Therefore, system administrators need to use relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and timely discovery and resolution of abnormal restarts. Thus, reasonably implementing host abnormal restart monitoring can help enterprises quickly diagnose problems, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance user experience.

- Function Optimization

    - Idle Host Inspection: Added cost-related information association for cloud host types.

### Intelligent Inspection Update

#### Added Inspections

- **RUM Performance Inspection:** Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an application performance monitoring technology aimed at assessing website performance by simulating real user behavior when browsing websites. The purpose of RUM is to understand website performance from the user's perspective, understanding website load times, webpage rendering effects, loading situations of page elements, and interaction responses. The use cases for RUM performance inspections mainly focus on client-type websites, such as e-commerce websites, financial websites, entertainment websites, etc., which all require presenting users with fast and smooth access experiences. By analyzing RUM performance results, developers can quickly understand actual user experiences to improve website performance promptly.
- **Kubernetes Health Inspection:** Nowadays, Kubernetes has swept the entire container ecosystem, acting as the brain for distributed container deployments, managing service-oriented applications using containers distributed across host clusters. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updates, service discovery, and scaling, but how do we ensure the health of Kubernetes nodes? Through intelligent inspections, current node resource states, application performance management, service fault logs, etc., can be retrieved and problems identified, thereby accelerating event investigations, reducing engineers' pressure, reducing mean time to repair, and improving end-user experience.

More intelligent inspection updates can be found in the **Intelligent Inspection Update Log**.
