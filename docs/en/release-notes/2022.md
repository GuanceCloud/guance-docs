### Intelligent Inspection Updates

#### Official Intelligent Inspection Offline

The official intelligent inspections for "memory leaks," "application performance monitoring," and "disk usage rate" have been discontinued starting today. Users can configure self-built inspection scripts instead.

#### Added Cloud Account Instance Dimension Billing Inspection

Cloud account instance dimension billing inspection helps users manage abnormal fee warnings at the cloud service instance level, predict cost situations, and provide users with high-growth, high-consumption instance tips and bill visualization capabilities. It supports multi-dimensional visualizations of cloud service resource consumption.

#### Added AliCloud Preemptible Instance Survival Inspection

Due to fluctuations in the market price of preemptible instances, it is necessary to specify a bidding model when creating preemptible instances. A preemptible instance can only be successfully created when the real-time market price of the specified instance specification is lower than the bid and there is sufficient inventory. Therefore, inspecting preemptible instances for cloud assets becomes particularly important. Through inspection, when a preemptible instance is about to be released, it will prompt the latest prices of all available zones for the current specification of the preemptible instance and provide appropriate handling suggestions based on historical prices.

For more intelligent inspection updates, refer to **Intelligent Inspection Update Logs**.

## June 6, 2022

### <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Update

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> billing optimizes the **Time Series** billing logic and the **data retention policy** for metric data. The original cost per 300 items at 3 yuan was reduced to 3 yuan per 1000 items. At the same time, metric data added 3-day, 7-day, and 14-day data retention policies, supporting **custom data retention policies** for metric sets.

Time series statistics include all combinations of labels for the metric data reported in the current workspace. The data retention policy refers to the data storage duration, which is the data retention time for data reported to the current workspace; data exceeding the storage duration will be automatically deleted.

Time series are fully counted, meaning each day’s time series will be cumulatively added during the data retention period. The longer the data retention policy, the higher the time series costs.

This optimization allows more flexible adjustment of the data retention policy for metrics, helping you save costs.

### <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Updates

#### Added Jenkins CI Observability

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> added Jenkins CI observability. You can directly view the results of Jenkins CI through <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s CI visualization function.

#### Added Outer Functions to DQL

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> added two outer functions `rate()` and `irate()`.

- `rate()`: Calculates the average change rate of a specific metric over a certain time range. Suitable for alarms and slowly moving counters.
- `irate()`: Calculates the instantaneous change rate of a specific metric over a certain time range, suitable for drawing volatile, fast-changing counters.

For more details, refer to the document **DQL Outer Functions**.
