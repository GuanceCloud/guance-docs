#### Added Cloud Account Instance Dimension Billing Inspection

Cloud account instance dimension billing inspection helps users manage abnormal cost warnings at the cloud service instance level, predict cost situations, and provide users with high-growth and high-consumption instance tips and bill visualization capabilities, supporting multi-dimensional visualizations of cloud service resource consumption.

#### Added AliCloud Preemptible Instance Survival Inspection

Due to fluctuations in market prices for preemptible instances, you need to specify a bidding model when creating preemptible instances. When the real-time market price for the specified instance specification is lower than the bid and inventory is sufficient, the preemptible instance can be successfully created. Therefore, inspections for preemptible instances of cloud assets become particularly important. Through inspection, if it is found that a preemptible instance is about to be released, it will prompt the latest price of the preemptible instance across all available zones for the current specification and provide appropriate handling suggestions.

More intelligent inspection updates can be referenced in **Intelligent Inspection Update Log**.

## June 6, 2022

### <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Update

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> billing optimizes the **Time Series** billing logic and the **data retention policy** for metric data. The original rate of 3 yuan per 300 items has been reduced to 3 yuan per 1000 items. Simultaneously, metric data adds 3-day, 7-day, 14-day data retention policies, with metric sets supporting **custom data retention policies**.

Time series statistics count the total combinations of labels in the reported metric data within the current workspace. Data retention policy refers to the data storage duration, which is the retention time of data reported to the current workspace. Data exceeding the storage duration will be automatically deleted.

Time series are fully counted, meaning daily generated time series within the data retention policy will accumulate sequentially. The longer the data retention policy, the higher the cost of time series.

This optimization allows you to adjust the data retention policy for metrics more flexibly, helping you save costs.

### <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Update

#### Added Jenkins CI Observability

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> added Jenkins CI observability, allowing you to directly view CI results in Jenkins through the CI visualization function of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>.

For more details, refer to **CI Visualization**.

![](img/17.CI_2.png)

#### Added Custom Viewer Chart Synchronized Search

Custom viewers added a synchronized search toggle switch, deciding whether search conditions affect chart queries, defaulting to enabled. When there is content in the search bar, disabling the switch returns the chart query to the default state; enabling the switch means the chart query is affected by the selected content.

![](img/6.custom_explorer_1.png)

#### Added Network Topology and Service Topology Drilling Analysis

In the infrastructure network topology diagram, clicking the host/Pod icon and then "View Upstream/Downstream" allows you to view the upstream/downstream node associations of the current node. In the upstream/downstream nodes, clicking the top-left "Return to Overview" brings you back to the original network topology diagram. Searching or filtering in the search bar filters associated upstream/downstream nodes, displaying matched upstream/downstream node associations according to the search or filter results. For more details, refer to the document **Network Upstream/Downstream Viewing**.

![](img/11.network_1.png)
In the service topology diagram, clicking the service icon and then "View Upstream/Downstream" allows you to view the upstream/downstream service associations of the current service. In the upstream/downstream services, clicking the top-left "Return to Overview" brings you back to the original service topology diagram. Searching or filtering in the search bar filters associated upstream/downstream services, displaying matched upstream/downstream service associations according to the search or filter results. For more details, refer to the document **Service Upstream/Downstream Viewing**.

![](img/12.apm_service_1.png)

#### Added Deletion of Resource Catalog Data and Indexes

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> supports owners and administrators deleting specified resource catalog classifications and all resource catalogs. Enter "Management" - "Basic Settings," click "Delete Resource Catalog," select the deletion method, and delete the corresponding object data.

- Specified Resource Catalog Classification: Only deletes data under the selected object classification, does not delete indexes
- All Resource Catalogs: Deletes all resource catalog data and indexes

Note: Once all resource catalogs are deleted, all custom-reported data and indexes in the infrastructure will be completely deleted and cannot be recovered. All set resource catalog classification data needs to be re-reported, with a maximum of 5 deletions of all resource catalogs allowed per day.

More resource catalog introductions can be referenced in the document **Customization**.

![](img/7.custom_cloud_3.png)
