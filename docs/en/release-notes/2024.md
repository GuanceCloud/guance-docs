# Change Log (2024)

---

## December 25, 2024

### OpenAPI Updates {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports fetching a list of resource catalogs, and supports [creating](../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modifying](../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[deleting](../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[exporting](../open-api/objc-set/export.md) resource viewers.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metrics, and supports [creating](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modifying](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enabling/disabling](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[deleting](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) metrics.

### Feature Updates {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automatic Writing of [Pipeline](../pipeline/index.md): Traditional log parsing methods often rely on familiarity with rules for manual script writing, which not only consumes a lot of time but also easily leads to errors, reducing the efficiency of writing Pipelines and making it difficult to respond to and solve problems in a timely manner. To improve efficiency and reduce labor costs, this feature leverages the natural language processing capabilities of large models to assist in automating log content parsing, helping developers write Pipelines more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large amounts of logs, simplifying data flow and processing.

#### Monitoring

AI Alert Compression and Merging: Through large models compressing and merging monitoring alert events, it reduces redundancy in alerts, especially when a system generates a large number of alerts within a short period. By consolidating alert events, it ensures that operations personnel receive only one comprehensive alert message within a specified time cycle (e.g., 10 minutes), rather than multiple duplicate alerts.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

Cloud billing scenario view and viewer added support for displaying categories of consumption currency.

#### Scenarios

1. Dashboards, built-in views add [identifier ID](../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely identified through identifier IDs. When configuring jump links within charts, you can use identifier IDs to locate dashboards or user views.
2. Viewer [auto-refresh](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#refresh) logic adjustment: Removed the "pause" button in the time component, added "off" option in the refresh frequency options, allowing users to disable auto-refresh as needed, simplifying and intuitively operating. Simultaneously removed the "viewer auto-refresh" switch in personal settings to avoid redundant features and optimize the user settings experience.
3. New functions added to viewers: `MD5()`, supporting querying log data with desensitization method as MD5 encryption in viewers.
4. Chart optimization: Charts now support obtaining PromQL metric names as legends, using `{__name__}` to configure alias display of metric names.
5. PromQL editor adds syntax highlighting and syntax hints.

#### Metrics

[Generate Metrics](../metrics/generate-metrics.md) Optimization:

1. Consolidated all types of generated metrics under the metric catalog for easier viewing and management by users.
2. Supports re-aggregation operations on existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing more dimensions for data analysis.

#### Management

Optimization of data access and sensitive data viewing desensitization rule application: Optimized multi-rule multi-role combined overlay data viewing scope. If members have multiple roles, the final data access scope takes the union of defined ranges within the rules, and sensitive data viewing desensitization rules are handled similarly.

#### Infrastructure

Resource Catalog [cross-workspace query](../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace): In the resource catalog menu, supports cross-workspace querying of resource list data.

### Deployment Plan Updates {#deployment1225}

1. Deployment Plan supports [customizing navigation bar and operation button display text](../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Backend management member menu optimization:

   - Added “login type” column, supporting differentiation between default login members and SSO login members, and allows filtering by login type;
   - For SSO login members, supports editing “other attributes” fields, allowing customization of attribute information. This information will be synchronized to Webhook externally and corresponding event content areas when sending alerts.

3. For workspaces with the main storage engine as Volc Engine, the storage strategy for traces, logs, and custom log indexes has been adjusted to: standard storage, infrequent storage, archive storage. These can be configured separately for hot data, infrequent data, and archive data storage durations. Additionally, if the main storage engine is Volc Engine, when adding an index in the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console, the storage strategy is synchronized to: standard storage, infrequent storage, archive storage.

### New Integrations {#inte1225}

- Added [VolcEngine ALB](../integrations/volcengine_alb.md) integration;
- Added [VolcEngine CLB](../integrations/volcengine_clb.md) integration;
- Added [VolcEngine NAS](../integrations/volcengine_nas.md) integration;

### Feature Updates {#feature1211}

#### Scenarios

1. [Topology Map](../scene/visual-chart/topology-map.md) added external data query: Allows users to draw topology maps through DataFlux Func. Users only need to connect data according to the chart structure to easily achieve external data visualization.
2. [Chart](../scene/visual-chart/index.md#type) Optimization
   - Chart display effect optimization: Optimized the display effect of charts, adjusted to slide out listed and categorized displays, making finding and using charts more convenient.
   - Chart description and applicable scenarios display: Added descriptions and applicable scenarios in the chart list, helping users better understand and choose appropriate chart types.
3. View Variable Optimization
   - View variables support configuring upper limits for value listings to prevent excessive data listings from causing page loading performance issues.
   - The default upper limit for deployment versions is 50, supporting customizable default listing quantities. Note: Page configuration restrictions take precedence over global restrictions.

#### Infrastructure

1. Resource Catalog Optimization:
   - Added grouping function: To improve resource management efficiency, added a resource grouping function. Users can group similar resources for easier management and viewing, optimizing the organization structure of resources.
   - Optimized Explorer Honeycomb Mode: Supports configuring "color fill" and "group analysis" field lists, allowing users to customize optional fields as needed.
2. Container and Resource Catalog Viewer Search Optimization: Container viewers added `container_name` search, and resource catalogs added `name` search.

#### Monitoring

Alert Policy Configuration Optimization

- Supports creating associated monitors [with one click via alert policy entry](../monitoring/alert-setting.md#with_monitor). Added unified alert notification management mode centered around alert policies.
- Optimized interaction for associated display in alert policy lists.

#### RUM

RUM added support for React Native application types and allows uploading SourceMap for data parsing and restoration. If you need to upload SourceMap for a React Native application originally created under Android/iOS types, note:

1. When creating a new application, select the "React Native" application type. During creation, you can directly copy the name and application ID of existing React Native applications under Android/iOS types, then click the "Create" button. After completing creation, you can configure SourceMap under this application. This change only affects the creation method of React Native applications and does not impact data collection.

2. If your original React Native application under Android/iOS types has associated monitors and you have not recreated the same ID React Native application under the "React Native" type, the original monitors can continue to work normally. However, if you have already recreated the "React Native" type application, the original monitors will not retrieve data in the "Application Name" field and will show as empty. In this case, you need to select "React Native" as the application type and save the monitor again.

#### APM

APM installation guide added [automatic injection method](../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM (APM) installation guide, added a Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method. This method simplifies the APM deployment process, allowing users to install and use it faster in Kubernetes environments.

- Monitoring:
  - [Intelligent Monitoring](../monitoring/intelligent-monitoring/index.md):
    - Host, log, and application intelligent detection frequency adjusted to execute every 10 minutes, with each execution counted as 10 calls in fees;
    - To improve algorithm accuracy, log and application intelligent detection now use data archiving. Enabling an intelligent monitor generates corresponding metrics sets and metric data. This change introduces additional time series, specifically the number of filtered dimensions (service, source) * detection metric count. Since monitor filter conditions are not stored, configuring new filter conditions on monitors will generate new equivalent time series on the day of modification, leading to duplicate time series billing on the modification day, which normalizes the next day.
