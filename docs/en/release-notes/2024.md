# Release Notes (2024)

---

## December 25, 2024

### OpenAPI Update {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports retrieving a list of resource catalogs, and supports [creation](../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modification](../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[deletion](../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[export](../open-api/objc-set/export.md) of resource explorers.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metrics, and supports [creation](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modification](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enable/disable](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[deletion](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) of metrics.

### Feature Update {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automatic writing of [Pipelines](../pipeline/index.md): Traditional log parsing methods often rely on familiarity with rules for manual script writing, which not only consumes a lot of time but also easily leads to errors, resulting in low efficiency in writing Pipelines and inability to respond and solve problems in time. To improve efficiency and reduce manual costs, this feature utilizes the natural language processing capabilities of large models to assist in automating log content parsing, helping developers write Pipelines more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large amounts of logs, simplifying data flow and processing.

#### Monitoring

AI Alert Compression and Consolidation: Through large models, compress and consolidate monitoring alert events, reducing redundancy in alert events, especially when the system generates a large number of alerts in a short period of time. By consolidating alert events, ensure that operations personnel receive a comprehensive alert message within a specified time cycle (e.g., 10 minutes), rather than multiple duplicate alert messages.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

Cloud billing scenario view and explorer add consumption currency category display.

#### Scenarios

1. Dashboards, built-in views add [ID markers](../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely determined via ID markers, and jump links can be configured in chart settings to locate dashboards or user views via ID markers.
2. Explorer [auto-refresh](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#refresh) logic adjustment: Remove the "pause" button in the time component, add an "off" option in the refresh frequency options, allowing users to turn off auto-refresh as needed, making operations simpler and more intuitive. At the same time, remove the "Explorer auto-refresh" switch in personal settings to avoid redundant functionality and optimize the user settings experience.
3. Explorer adds function: `MD5()`, supporting querying log data encrypted by MD5 in the explorer.
4. Chart Optimization: Charts support obtaining PromQL metric names as legends, and `{__name__}` can be used to configure metric name aliases for display.
5. PromQL editor adds syntax highlighting and syntax hints.

#### Metrics

[Generated Metrics](../metrics/generate-metrics.md) Optimization:

1. Consolidate all types of generated metrics under the metric directory for easy unified viewing and management by users.
2. Support re-aggregation operations on existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing more dimensions for data analysis.

#### Management

Optimization of desensitization rule application for data access and sensitive data viewing: Optimize the combination of multi-rule and multi-role data viewing ranges; if members have multiple roles, the final data access range is the union of the defined ranges in the rules, and the desensitization rules for sensitive data viewing follow the same principle.

#### Infrastructure

Resource Catalog [Cross-workspace Query](../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace): In the resource catalog menu, support cross-workspace queries for resource list data.

### Deployment Edition Update {#deployment1225}

1. Deployment edition supports [customizing navigation bar and operation button display text](../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Backend member menu optimization:

   - Add a "Login Type" column, supporting differentiation between default login members and SSO login members, and supporting filtering by login type;
   - For SSO login members, support editing "Other Attributes" fields, allowing customization of attribute information. This information will be synchronized to Webhook externally and corresponding event content areas when sending alerts.

3. For workspaces with the main storage engine being Volcengine, adjust the storage strategy for traces, logs, and custom log indexes to: standard storage, infrequent storage, and archive storage, which can be configured separately for hot data, infrequent data, and archive data storage durations. At the same time, if the main storage engine is Volcengine, when adding indexes in the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console, the storage strategy is also adjusted to: standard storage, infrequent storage, and archive storage.

- Optimized interaction for associated display in alert strategy lists.

#### RUM

RUM added support for React Native application types and allows uploading SourceMaps for data parsing and restoration. If you need to upload SourceMaps for React Native applications originally created under Android/iOS types, please note:

1. When creating a new application, select the "React Native" application type. During creation, you can directly copy the name and application ID of existing React Native applications under Android/iOS types, then click the "Create" button. After completion, you can configure SourceMaps under that application. This change only affects the creation method of React Native applications and does not impact data collection.

2. If your previously created React Native applications under Android/iOS types have associated monitors and you haven't recreated identical ID React Native applications under the "React Native" type, the original monitors can continue to work normally. However, if you have already recreated "React Native" type applications, the original monitors will not retrieve data in the "Application Name" item and will display as empty. In this case, you need to select the "React Native" application type and resave this monitor.

#### APM

APM Installation Guide added [automatic injection method](../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM installation guide, a new Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method has been added. This method simplifies the APM deployment process, enabling users to install and use APM more quickly in Kubernetes environments.

## January 31, 2024

### <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Update

- Monitoring:
  - [Smart Monitoring](../monitoring/intelligent-monitoring/index.md):
    - Host, log, application intelligent detection frequency adjusted to execute every 10 minutes, with each execution counting as 10 calls in fees;
    - To improve algorithm accuracy, log and application intelligent detection adopt a data retention method. After enabling one smart monitor, corresponding measurement sets and metric data are generated. This adjustment generates additional timelines, specifically the number of current monitor configuration filtering conditions (service, source) * number of detection metrics, since no storage of monitor filtering conditions occurs. If monitor filtering condition configurations are modified, new equivalent timelines are generated on the modification day, leading to timeline duplicate billing on the modification day, returning to normal the next day after modification.
