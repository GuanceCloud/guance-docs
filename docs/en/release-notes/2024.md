# Release Notes (2024)

---

## December 25, 2024

### OpenAPI Updates {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports retrieving a list of resource catalogs, supports [creation](../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modification](../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[deletion](../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[export](../open-api/objc-set/export.md) of resource viewers.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metrics, supports [creation](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modification](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enable/disable](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[deletion](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) of metrics.

### Feature Updates {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automated [Pipeline](../pipeline/index.md) Writing: Traditional log parsing methods often rely on familiarity with rules for manual script writing, which not only consumes a lot of time but also easily leads to errors, resulting in low efficiency in writing Pipelines and inability to respond and solve problems promptly. To improve efficiency and reduce labor costs, this feature leverages the natural language processing capabilities of large models to assist in the automated parsing of log content, helping developers write Pipelines more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large amounts of logs, simplifying data flows and processing procedures.

#### Monitoring

AI Alert Compression Merging: Through large models, alert events for monitoring are compressed and merged, reducing redundancy in alert events, especially when systems generate a large number of alerts in a short period of time. By integrating alert events, it ensures that operations personnel receive only one comprehensive alert within a specified time cycle (e.g., 10 minutes), rather than multiple repeated alert messages.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

New display category for consumption currency added to cloud billing scenario views and viewers.

#### Scenarios

1. Dashboards, built-in views added [ID marker](../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely determined via ID markers. Links for chart configurations can be used to locate dashboards or user views through ID markers.
2. Adjusted logic for viewer [auto-refresh](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#refresh): Removed the "pause" button in the time component, added "off" to refresh frequency options, allowing users to turn off auto-refresh as needed, making operations simpler and more intuitive. At the same time, removed the "viewer auto-refresh" switch from personal settings to avoid redundant functions and optimize user settings experience.
3. Added function to viewer: `MD5()`, supporting querying MD5 encrypted log data in viewers.
4. Chart Optimization: Charts support obtaining PromQL metric names for legends, using `{__name__}` to configure metric names as aliases.
5. PromQL editor added syntax highlighting and syntax suggestions.

#### Metrics

[Generated Metrics](../metrics/generate-metrics.md) Optimization:

1. Consolidated all types of generated metrics under the metrics directory for easier viewing and management by users.
2. Supports re-aggregation operations on existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing more dimensions for data analysis.

#### Management

Optimization of application of desensitization rules for data access and sensitive data viewing: Optimized multi-rule multi-role combination overlay data viewing range. If members have multiple roles, the final data access range takes the union of ranges defined in the rules. The same applies to desensitization rules for sensitive data viewing.

#### Infrastructure

Resource catalog [cross-workspace queries](../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace): In the resource catalog menu, implemented support for cross-workspace queries of resource list data.

### Deployment Edition Update {#deployment1225}

1. Deployment edition supports [customizing navigation bar and operation button text](../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Member menu optimization in the management backend:

   - Added a "login type" column, supporting differentiation between default login members and SSO login members, with filtering by login type supported;
   - For SSO login members, editing of "other attributes" fields is supported, allowing customization of attribute information. This information will be synchronized to Webhook externally and corresponding event content areas when sending alerts.

3. Storage strategy adjustment for workspaces with main storage engine as Volcengine: Storage strategies for traces, logs, and custom log indexes adjusted to standard storage, infrequent storage, and archive storage, each configurable for hot data, infrequent data, and archive data retention periods. At the same time, if the main storage engine is Volcengine, when adding an index in <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console, the storage strategy synchronizes to standard storage, infrequent storage, and archive storage.

### New Integrations {#inte1225}

- Added [Volcengine ALB](../integrations/volcengine_alb.md) integration;
- Added [Volcengine CLB](../integrations/volcengine_clb.md) integration;

#### RUM

RUM added support for React Native application types and allows uploading SourceMaps for data parsing and restoration. If you need to upload SourceMaps for React Native applications originally created under Android / iOS types, please note:

1. When creating a new application, select the "React Native" application type. During creation, you can directly copy the name and application ID of existing React Native applications under Android / iOS types, then click the "Create" button. After completion, you can configure SourceMaps under this application. This change only involves the creation method of React Native applications and will not affect data collection.

2. If your React Native applications under Android / iOS types have associated monitors and you have not recreated React Native applications with the same ID under the "React Native" type, the original monitors can continue to work normally. However, if you have already recreated "React Native" type applications, the original monitors will not retrieve data in the "Application Name" item, showing as blank. In this case, you need to select the "React Native" application type and resave the monitor.

#### APM

APM installation guide added [automatic injection method](../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM (Application Performance Monitoring) installation guide, added a Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method.

- Monitoring:
  - [Intelligent Monitoring](../monitoring/intelligent-monitoring/index.md):
    - Host, log, application intelligent detection frequency adjusted to execute every 10 minutes, each execution counts as 10 calls for fee calculation;
    - To enhance algorithm accuracy, log and application intelligent detection adopts data retention method. After enabling one intelligent monitoring, corresponding Measurement and metric data are generated. This adjustment produces additional timelines, specifically the number of filtered dimensions (service, source) in the current monitor configuration multiplied by the number of detected metrics. Since monitor filtering conditions are not stored, if the monitor filtering condition configuration changes, new equivalent timelines are generated on the day of modification, resulting in duplicate timeline billing on the same day. The next day after modification returns to normal.
