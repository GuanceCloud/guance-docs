# Release Notes (2024)

---

## December 25, 2024

### OpenAPI Update {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports retrieving resource catalog lists and supports [creation](../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modification](../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[deletion](../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[export](../open-api/objc-set/export.md) of resource viewers.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metric lists and supports [creation](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modification](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enable/disable](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[deletion](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) of metrics.

### Feature Updates {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automatically write [Pipeline](../pipeline/index.md): Traditional log parsing methods often rely on familiarity with rules to manually script, which not only consumes a lot of time but also easily leads to errors, resulting in low efficiency in writing Pipelines and inability to respond promptly to problems. To improve efficiency and reduce manual costs, this function uses the natural language processing capabilities of large models to assist in automatically parsing log content, helping developers write Pipelines more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large amounts of logs, simplifying data flow and processing.

#### Monitoring

AI Alert Compression and Consolidation: Compresses and consolidates monitoring alert events through large models, reducing redundancy in alert events, especially when the system generates a large number of alerts in a short period. By integrating alert events, it ensures that operations personnel receive a single comprehensive alert message within a specified time cycle (e.g., 10 minutes), rather than multiple repetitive alert messages.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

New consumption currency categories displayed in cloud billing scenario views and viewers.

#### Scenarios

1. Dashboards, built-in views add [ID markers](../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely determined via ID markers, allowing for positioning dashboards or user views through jump links configured within charts.
2. Adjusted logic for viewer [auto-refresh](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#refresh): Removed the "pause" button in the time component, added a "off" option to the refresh frequency options, allowing users to disable auto-refresh as needed, making operations simpler and more intuitive. At the same time, removed the "viewer auto-refresh" switch in personal settings to avoid functional redundancy and optimize user settings experience.
3. New functions added to viewers: `MD5()`, supporting querying log data masked by MD5 encryption in viewers.
4. Chart Optimization: Charts support obtaining PromQL metric names for legends, using `{__name__}` to configure metric names as aliases.
5. PromQL editor adds syntax highlighting and syntax suggestions.

#### Metrics

Optimization of [generated metrics](../metrics/generate-metrics.md):

1. Integrated all types of generated metrics under the metrics directory for easier viewing and management by users.
2. Supports re-aggregation operations on existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing more dimensions for data analysis.

#### Management

Optimization of application of desensitization rules for data access and sensitive data viewing: Optimized multi-rule multi-role combined stacking data viewing scope. If members have multiple roles, the final data access scope takes the union of the ranges defined in the rules, and the desensitization rules for sensitive data viewing follow the same principle.

#### Infrastructure

Resource Catalog [cross-workspace query](../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace): In the resource catalog menu, supports cross-workspace querying of resource list data.

### Deployment Edition Update {#deployment1225}

1. Deployment edition supports [customizing navigation bar and action button display text](../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Member menu optimization in the management backend:

   - Added "login type" column, supporting differentiation between default login members and SSO login members, and supports filtering by login type;
   - For SSO login members, supports editing "other attributes" fields, allowing customization of attribute information. This information will be synchronized to Webhook externally and corresponding event content areas when sending alerts.

3. Storage strategy adjustment for workspaces with primary storage engine as Volcengine: The storage strategy for traces, logs, and custom log indexes is adjusted to standard storage, infrequent storage, and archive storage, which can be separately configured for hot data, infrequent data, and archive data storage durations. Simultaneously, if the primary storage engine is Volcengine, when adding an index in the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console, the storage strategy is also synchronized to standard storage, infrequent storage, and archive storage.

### New Integrations {#inte1225}

- Added [Volcengine ALB](../integrations/volcengine_alb.md) integration;
- Added [Volcengine CLB](../integrations/volcengine_clb.md) integration;

#### RUM

RUM added support for React Native application types and allows uploading SourceMap for data parsing and restoration. If you need to upload SourceMap for a React Native application originally created under Android/iOS types, please note:

1. When creating a new application, select the "React Native" application type. During creation, you can directly copy the name and application ID of the existing React Native application under Android/iOS type, then click the "Create" button. After creation, you can configure SourceMap under this application. This change only involves the creation method of React Native applications and does not affect data collection.

2. If your original React Native application under Android/iOS type has associated monitors and you have not yet recreated the same ID React Native application under the "React Native" type, the original monitors can continue to work normally. However, if you have already recreated the "React Native" type application, the original monitors will not be able to retrieve data in the "Application Name" item and will show as empty. In this case, you need to select the "React Native" application type and save the monitor again.

#### APM

APM Installation Guide Added [Auto Injection Method](../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM (Application Performance Monitoring) installation guide, added a Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method.

- Monitoring:
  - [Intelligent Monitoring](../monitoring/intelligent-monitoring/index.md):
    - Host, log, application intelligent detection frequency adjusted to execute every 10 minutes, each execution counting as 10 calls for billing purposes;
    - To improve algorithm precision, log and application intelligent detection adopt a data retention method, generating corresponding measurement sets and metric data upon enabling intelligent monitoring. This adjustment generates additional timelines, specifically the number of current monitored configuration filtered dimensions (service, source) multiplied by the number of detected metrics. Since monitor filter conditions are not stored, if monitor filter conditions are modified, new equivalent timelines are generated, resulting in timeline double billing on the modification day, returning to normal the next day.
