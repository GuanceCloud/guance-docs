# Release Notes (2024)

---

## December 25, 2024

### OpenAPI Update {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports retrieving a list of resource catalogs, supports [create](../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modify](../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[delete](../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[export](../open-api/objc-set/export.md) Explorer for resources.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metrics lists, supports [create](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modify](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enable/disable](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[delete](../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) metrics.

### Feature Updates {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automatically writing [Pipeline](../pipeline/index.md): Traditional log parsing methods often rely on familiarity with rules to manually write scripts, which not only consumes a lot of time but also easily leads to errors, reducing the efficiency of writing Pipelines and making it difficult to respond and solve problems in a timely manner. To improve efficiency and reduce manual costs, this feature leverages large models' natural language processing capabilities to assist in automating log content parsing, helping developers more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large amounts of logs, simplifying data flow and processing.

#### Monitoring

AI Alert Compression and Merging: Through large models compressing and merging monitoring alert events, reduces redundancy of alerts, especially when the system generates a large number of alerts in a short period. By consolidating alert events, ensures that operations personnel receive only one comprehensive alert message within a specified time cycle (e.g., 10 minutes), rather than multiple repetitive alert messages.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

Cloud billing scenario views and Explorer add display categories for consumption currencies.

#### Scenarios

1. Dashboards, built-in views add [ID marker](../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely determined through ID markers. When configuring jump links inside charts, you can locate dashboards or user views via the ID marker.
2. Explorer [auto-refresh](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-analysis.md#refresh) logic adjustment: Remove the "pause" button in the time component, add an "off" option in the refresh frequency options, allowing users to disable the auto-refresh function as needed, making operations simpler and more intuitive. At the same time, remove the "Explorer auto-refresh" switch in personal settings to avoid redundant functions and optimize the user settings experience.
3. Added function to Explorer: `MD5()`, supporting querying MD5 encrypted log data in the Explorer.
4. Chart Optimization: Support using PromQL metric names as legends in charts, and use `{__name__}` to configure metric names as aliases for display.
5. PromQL Editor adds syntax highlighting and syntax hints.

#### Metrics

[Generate Metrics](../metrics/generate-metrics.md) optimization:

1. Consolidate all types of generated metrics under the Metrics directory for easier unified viewing and management by users.
2. Support re-aggregating existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing additional dimensions for data analysis.

#### Management

Data access and sensitive data view desensitization rule application optimization: Optimize the combination of multi-rule and multi-role data view scope. If members have multiple roles, the final data access scope is the union of the ranges defined in the rules, and the desensitization rules for sensitive data view follow the same principle.

#### Infrastructure

Resource Catalog [cross-workspace query](../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace): In the resource catalog menu, support cross-workspace queries for resource list data.

### Deployment Edition Update {#deployment1225}

1. Deployment Edition supports [customizing navigation bar and action button display text](../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Member menu optimization in the management backend:

   - Add a "login type" column to distinguish between default login members and SSO login members, and support filtering by login type;
   - For SSO login members, support editing "other attributes" fields, enabling customization of attribute information. This information will be synchronized to Webhook externally and the corresponding event content area when sending alerts.

3. Workspaces with main storage engine as Volcengine adjust storage strategies for traces, logs, and custom log indexes to: standard storage, low-frequency storage, and archive storage, each configurable for hot data, low-frequency data, and archive data retention periods. Simultaneously, if the main storage engine is Volcengine, when adding indexes in the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console, the storage strategy synchronizes to: standard storage, low-frequency storage, and archive storage.

- Optimized interaction for displaying related alert policies in the alert policy list.

#### RUM

RUM added support for React Native application types and allows uploading SourceMaps for data parsing and recovery. If you need to upload SourceMaps for React Native applications originally created under Android / iOS types, please note:

1. When creating a new application, choose the "React Native" application type. During creation, you can directly copy the name and application ID of existing React Native applications under the Android / iOS type, then click the "Create" button. After completion, you can configure SourceMaps under this application. This change only involves the creation method of React Native applications and will not affect data collection.

2. If your previously created React Native applications under Android / iOS types are associated with monitors and you haven't recreated the same ID React Native applications under the "React Native" type, the original monitors can continue to work normally. However, if you have already recreated "React Native" type applications, the original monitors will not retrieve data under the "Application Name" item and will show as blank. In this case, you need to select the "React Native" application type and resave this monitor.

#### APM

APM installation guide added [automatic injection method](../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM (APM) installation guide, added Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method.

#### Incident Management

Incident Issues and monitor events: If content contains `@ member` configuration, then during external transmission via Webhook, Issues or events will carry synchronized account attribute information for `@ members`.

#### Monitoring

1. External event detection: Supports adding custom event occurrence times and label attributes. Note:
   - Field values must uniformly use string types;
   - Field names cannot start with `_` underscores or `df_` prefixes and cannot duplicate default event field names;
   - Custom label field names cannot duplicate field names defined in `dimension_tags`.
2. Terminology adjustment: “No Data” officially updated to “Data Outage” to ensure a unified viewing experience for page configurations.

#### Pipeline

Separate processing of testing data and log data, and add a new "Synthetic Testing" data type. This avoids mutual interference during data processing, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in data handling.

- Monitoring:
  - [Intelligent Monitoring](../monitoring/intelligent-monitoring/index.md):
    - Host, log, application intelligent detection frequency adjusted to execute every 10 minutes, each execution counted as 10 calls;
    - To improve algorithm accuracy, log and application intelligent detection adopts data retention methods. After enabling intelligent monitoring, corresponding measurement sets and metric data will be generated. This adjustment produces additional timelines, specifically the number of detection dimensions (service, source) filtered by the current monitoring configuration's filter conditions * the number of detection metrics. Since monitoring filter conditions are not stored, if modifications occur to the monitoring filter conditions, new equivalent timelines will be generated on the modification day, resulting in repeated timeline billing on the day of modification, which will return to normal the next day after modification.
