Datakit supports subscribing messages from kafka to gather link, metric, and log information. Currently, only `SkyWalking`,`Jaeger` and `custom topic` are supported.

### Configure datakit {#datakit-config}
Copy configuration files and modify

=== "Host deployment"

    Go to the `conf.d/kafkamq` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `kafkamq.conf.sample` and name it `kafkamq.conf`. Examples are as follows:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.kafkamq]]
      addrs = ["localhost:9092"]
      # your kafka version:0.8.2 ~ 3.2.0
      kafka_version = "2.0.0"
      group_id = "datakit-group"
      # consumer group partition assignment strategy (range, roundrobin, sticky)
      assignor = "roundrobin"
    
      ## rate limit.
      #limit_sec = 100
      ## sample
      # sampling_rate = 1.0
    
      ## kafka tls config
      # tls_enable = true
      # tls_security_protocol = "SASL_PLAINTEXT"
      # tls_sasl_mechanism = "PLAIN"
      # tls_sasl_plain_username = "user"
      # tls_sasl_plain_password = "pw"
    
      ## -1:Offset Newest, -2:Offset Oldest
      offsets=-1
    
      ## skywalking custom
      #[inputs.kafkamq.skywalking]
        ## Required！send to datakit skywalking input.
        #dk_endpoint="http://localhost:9529"
    
        #topics = [
        #  "skywalking-metrics",
        #  "skywalking-profilings",
        #  "skywalking-segments",
        #  "skywalking-managements",
        #  "skywalking-meters",
        #  "skywalking-logging",
        #]
        #namespace = ""
    
      ## Jaeger from kafka. Please make sure your Datakit Jaeger collector is open ！！！
      #[inputs.kafkamq.jaeger]
        ## Required！ ipv6 is "[::1]:9529"
        #dk_endpoint="http://localhost:9529"
    
        ## Required！ topics 
        #topics=["jaeger-spans","jaeger-my-spans"]
    
      ## user custom message with PL script.
      #[inputs.kafkamq.custom]
        #spilt_json_body = true
        #[inputs.kafkamq.custom.log_topic_map]
        #  "log_topic"="log.p"
        #  "log01"="log_01.p"
        #[inputs.kafkamq.custom.metric_topic_map]
        #  "metric_topic"="metric.p"
        #  "metric01"="rum_apm.p"
        #[inputs.kafkamq.custom.rum_topic_map]
        #  "rum_topic"="rum_01.p"
        #  "rum_02"="rum_02.p"
    
    
      ## todo: add other input-mq
    
    ```

=== "Kubernetes/Docker/Containerd"

    The collector can now be turned on by [ConfigMap Injection Collector Configuration](datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).   


Notes on configuration files:
1. `kafka_version`: The version length is 3, such as 1.0.0, 1.2.1, and so on.
2. `offsets`: note: Newest or Oldest.
3. `SASL`: If security authentication is enabled, please configure the user and password correctly.



## SkyWalking {#kafkamq-SkyWalking}
The kafka plugin will send `traces`, `JVM metrics`, `logging`, `Instance Properties`, and `profiled snapshots` to the kafka cluster by default.

This feature is disabled by default. Need to put `kafka-reporter-plugin-x.y.z.jar` from `agent/optional-reporter-plugins` into `agent/plugins` to take effect.

config:
```toml
  ## skywalking custom
  [inputs.kafkamq.skywalking]
    ## Required！send to datakit skywalking input.
    dk_endpoint="http://localhost:9529"

    topics = [
      "skywalking-metrics",
      "skywalking-profilings",
      "skywalking-segments",
      "skywalking-managements",
      "skywalking-meters",
      "skywalking-logging",
    ]
    namespace = ""
```

Open the comment to start the subscription. The subscribed topic is in the skywalking agent configuration file `config/agent.config`.

Note: This collector just forwards the subscribed data to the datakit skywalking collector, please open the [skywalking](skywalking.md) collector and open the dk_endpoint comment!

## Jaeger {#jaeger}

Configuration：
```toml
  ## Jaeger from kafka. Please make sure your Datakit Jaeger collector is open ！！！
  [inputs.kafkamq.jaeger]
    ## Required！ ipv6 is "[::1]:9529"
    dk_endpoint="http://localhost:9529"

    ## Required！ topics 
    topics=["jaeger-spans","jaeger-my-spans"]
```

Note: This collector just forwards the subscribed data to the datakit Jaeger collector, please open the [jaeger](jaeger.md) collector and open the `dk_endpoint` comment!

## Custom Topic {#kafka-custom}

Sometimes users don't use common tools in the market, and some tripartite libraries are not open source, and the data structure is not public. This requires manual processing according to the collected data structure, which reflects the power of pipeline, and users can subscribe and consume messages through custom configuration.

Configuration:
```toml
 ...
  ## user custom message with PL script.
  [inputs.kafkamq.custom]
    #spilt_json_body = true
    [inputs.kafkamq.custom.log_topic_map]
      "log_topic"="log.p"
      "log"="rum_apm.p"
    [inputs.kafkamq.custom.metric_topic_map]
      "metric_topic"="rum_apm.p"
      
    [inputs.kafkamq.custom.rum_topic_map]
      "rum"="rum.p"
      
```

Note: The pl script of metric should be placed in the `pipeline/metric/` directory, and the pl script of rum should be placed in the `pipeline/rum/` directory.

Theoretically, each message body should be a log or an indicator. If your message is multiple logs, you can use `spilt_json_body` to enable the function of splitting arrays: When the data is an array and conforms to the json format, it can be set to true, and PL can be used to Arrays are sliced into individual log or metric data.


### Example {#example}

Take a simple metric as an example to show you how to subscribe to messages using custom configuration.

When you don't know what format the data structure sent to kafka is. You can change the logging level of datakit to debug first. Open the subscription, and there will be output in the datakit log. Suppose you get the following data:
```shell
# After opening the debug log level, look at the log, and datakit prints out the message information.
tailf /var/log/datakit/log | grep "kafka_message"
```

Suppose you get a json-formatted plain text string of metric:

```json
{"time": 1666492218, "dimensions": {"bk_biz_id": 225,"ip": "10.200.64.45" },  "metrics": { "cpu_usage_pct": 0.01}, "exemplar": null}
```


With the data format, you can write pipeline scripts by hand. Log in to Guance Cloud-> Management-> Text Processing (Pipeline) to write scripts. Such as:

```toml
data=load_json(message)
drop_origin_data()

hostip=data["dimensions"]["ip"]
bkzid=data["bk_biz_id"]
cast(bkzid,"sttr")

set_tag(hostip,hostip)
set_tag(bk_biz_id,bkzid)

add_key(cpu_usage_pct,data["metrics"]["cpu_usage_pct"])
# Note that this is the line protocol default, and the message_len can be deleted after the pl script is passed.
drop_key(message_len)
```

Place the file in the directory `/usr/local/datakit/pipeline/metric/`.

> Note: The pl script for metrics data is placed under `metric/` and the pl script for logging data is placed under `pipeline/`

Configure the PL script and restart datakit.

## benchmark {#benchmark}

The consumption capability of messages is limited by the network and bandwidth, so the benchmark test only tests the consumption capability of DK rather than the IO capability. The machine configuration for this test is 4 cores, 8 threads, and 16G memory.


| message num | time  | num/Second |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| 100k        | 5s~7s | 16k        |
| 1000k       | 1m30s | 11k        |

## load balancing {#load balancing}
When the amount of messages is large and the consumption capacity of one datakit is insufficient, multiple datakits can be added for consumption. Here are three points to note:

1. Make sure that the topic partition is not one (at least 2), which can be viewed through the tool [kafka-map](https://github.com/dushixiang/kafka-map/releases){:target="_blank"}
1. Make sure that the configuration of the kafkamq collector is assignor = "roundrobin" (a type of load balancing strategy), group_id="datakit" (group names must be consistent, otherwise consumption will be repeated)
1. Make sure that the producer of the message sends the message to multiple partitions. The method is different for different languages. The code is not listed here, and you can google it yourself.

## Troubleshooting {#some_problems}

Script test command to see if cutting is correct:

```shell
datakit pipeline -P metric.p -T '{"time": 1666492218,"dimensions":{"bk_biz_id": 225,"ip": "172.253.64.45"},"metrics": {"cpu_usage_pct": 0.01}, "exemplar": null}'
```

Set outputfile to local to see if the line protocol format is correct:
```shell
vim conf/datakit.conf
# If it is set to a local file, it will not be output to io, and it can be assigned to null after the test.
output_file = "/usr/local/datakit/out.pts"
# Check to see if the file out.pts is correct
```

Connection failure may be a version problem: Please fill in the kafka version correctly in the configuration file.

Other issues:

View through the `datakit monitor` command, or through `datakit monitor -V`.
