</div>

## Preconditions {#requirements}

- Deploy DataKit to be publicly accessible

It is recommended that RUM be deployed separately on the public network, ==not with existing services== (such as Kubernetes cluster). As the traffic on RUM interface may be very large, the traffic within the cluster will be disturbed by it, and some possible resource scheduling mechanisms within the cluster may affect the operation of RUM services.

- On the DataKit [install IP geo-Repository](datakit-tools-how-to.md#install-ipdb)
- Since [1.2.7](changelog.md#cl-1.2.7), due to the adjustment of the installation method of IP geographic information base, the default installation no longer comes with its own IP information base, but needs to be installed manually.

## Configuration {#config}

=== "Host Installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/rum` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `rum.conf.sample` and name it `rum.conf`. Examples are as follows:
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.rum]]
      ## profile Agent endpoints register by version respectively.
      ## Endpoints can be skipped listen by remove them from the list.
      ## Default value set as below. DO NOT MODIFY THESE ENDPOINTS if not necessary.
      endpoints = ["/v1/write/rum"]
    
      ## use to upload rum screenshot,html,etc...
      session_replay_endpoints = ["/v1/write/rum/replay"]
    
      ## Android command-line-tools HOME
      android_cmdline_home = "/usr/local/datakit/data/rum/tools/cmdline-tools"
    
      ## proguard HOME
      proguard_home = "/usr/local/datakit/data/rum/tools/proguard"
    
      ## android-ndk HOME
      ndk_home = "/usr/local/datakit/data/rum/tools/android-ndk"
    
      ## atos or atosl bin path
      ## for macOS datakit use the built-in tool atos default
      ## for Linux there are several tools that can be used to instead of macOS atos partially,
      ## such as https://github.com/everettjf/atosl-rs
      atos_bin_path = "/usr/local/datakit/data/rum/tools/atosl"
    
      ## Threads config controls how many goroutines an agent cloud start to handle HTTP request.
      ## buffer is the size of jobs' buffering of worker channel.
      ## threads is the total number fo goroutines at running time.
      # [inputs.rum.threads]
        # buffer = 100
        # threads = 8
    
      ## Storage config a local storage space in hard dirver to cache trace data.
      ## path is the local file path used to cache data.
      ## capacity is total space size(MB) used to store data.
      # [inputs.rum.storage]
        # path = "./rum_storage"
        # capacity = 5120
    
    ```
    
    After configuration, [restart DataKit](datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    In datakit.yaml, the environment variable `ENV_DEFAULT_ENABLED_INPUTS` adds the rum collector name (as shown in the first in `value` below):
    
    ```yaml
    - name: ENV_DEFAULT_ENABLED_INPUTS
      value: rum,cpu,disk,diskio,mem,swap,system,hostobject,net,host_processes,container
    ```

## Security Restrictions {#security-setting}

Because RUM DataKit is generally deployed in a public network environment, but only uses a specific [DataKit API](apis.md) interface, other interfaces cannot be opened. API access control can be tightened by modifying the following *public_apis* field configuration in *datakit.conf*:

```toml
[http_api]
  rum_origin_ip_header = "X-Forwarded-For"
  listen = "0.0.0.0:9529"
  disable_404page = true
  rum_app_id_white_list = []

  public_apis = [  # If the list is empty, all APIs do not do access control
    "/v1/write/rum",
    "/some/other/apis/..."

    # Other APIs can only be accessed by localhost, for example, datakit-M needs to access the/stats interface.
    # In addition, DCA is not affected by this because it is a stand-alone HTTP server.
  ]
```

Other interfaces are still available, but can only be accessed natively through the DataKit, such as [query DQL](datakit-dql-how-to.md) or view [DataKit running status](datakit-tools-how-to.md#using-monitor).

### Disable DataKit 404 Page {#disable-404}

You can disable public network access to DataKit 404 pages with the following configuration:

```toml
# datakit.conf
disable_404page = true
```

## Measurements {#measurements}

The RUM collector collects the following measurements by default:

- `error`
- `view`
- `resource`
- `long_task`
- `action`

## Sourcemap Transformation {#sourcemap}

Usually, js files in production environment or App code on mobile side will be confused and compressed to reduce the size of application. The call stack when an error occurs is quite different from the source code at development time, which is inconvenient for debugging (`troubleshoot`). If you need to locate errors in the source code, you have to rely on the `sourcemap` file.

DataKit supports this mapping of source code file information by zipping the corresponding symbol table file, named `<app_id>-<env>-<version>.zip` and uploading it to`<DataKit Installation Directory>/data/rum/<platform>` so that the reported `error` measurement data can be automatically converted and the `error_stack_source` field appended to the measurement.

### Install the sourcemap Toolset {#install-tools}

First, you need to install the corresponding symbol restoration tool. Datakit provides a one-click installation command to simplify the installation of the tool:

```shell
sudo datakit install --symbol-tools
```

If a software installation fails during the installation process, you may need to manually install the corresponding software according to the error prompt.


### Zip Packaging Instructions {#zip}

=== "Web"

    After the js file is obfuscated and compressed by webpack, the `.map` file is zip compressed and packaged, and then copied to the `<DataKit installation directory>/data/rum/web`directory. It is necessary to ensure that the uncompressed file path of the compressed package is consistent with the URL path in `error_stack`. Assume the following `error_stack`：
    
    ```
    ReferenceError
      at a.hideDetail @ http://localhost:8080/static/js/app.7fb548e3d065d1f48f74.js:1:1037
      at a.showDetail @ http://localhost:8080/static/js/app.7fb548e3d065d1f48f74.js:1:986
      at <anonymous> @ http://localhost:8080/static/js/app.7fb548e3d065d1f48f74.js:1:1174
    ```
    
    The path to be converted is `/static/js/app.7fb548e3d065d1f48f74.js`, and its corresponding `sourcemap` path is `/static/js/app.7fb548e3d065d1f48f74.js.map`, so the directory structure of the corresponding compressed package after decompression is as follows:
    
    ```
    static/
    └── js
    └── app.7fb548e3d065d1f48f74.js.map
    
    ```
    
    After conversion `error_stack_source`：
    
    ```
    
    ReferenceError
      at a.hideDetail @ webpack:///src/components/header/header.vue:94:0
      at a.showDetail @ webpack:///src/components/header/header.vue:91:0
      at <anonymous> @ webpack:///src/components/header/header.vue:101:0
    ```

=== "Android"
    
    Android currently has two types of `sourcemap` files. One is the mapping file produced by Java bytecode obfuscated by `R8`/`Proguard` compression. The other is an (unstripped) `.so` file that does not clear the symbol table and debugging information when compiling C/C + + native code. If your android application contains these two `sourcemap` files at the same time, you need to package these two files into a zip package when packaging, and then copy the zip package to the `<DataKit installation directory>/data/rum/android` directory. The directory structure after zip package decompression is similar:
    
    ```
    <app_id>-<env>-<version>/
    ├── mapping.txt
    ├── armeabi-v7a/
    │   ├── libgameengine.so
    │   ├── libothercode.so
    │   └── libvideocodec.so
    ├── arm64-v8a/
    │   ├── libgameengine.so
    │   ├── libothercode.so
    │   └── libvideocodec.so
    ├── x86/
    │   ├── libgameengine.so
    │   ├── libothercode.so
    │   └── libvideocodec.so
    └── x86_64/
        ├── libgameengine.so
        ├── libothercode.so
        └── libvideocodec.so
    ```
    
    By default, the `mapping` file will be in: `<project folder>/<Module>/build/outputs/mapping/<build-type>/`, the `.so` file will be in: `<project folder>/<Module>/build/intermediates/cmake/debug/obj/` when compiling with ndk: `<project folder>/<Module>/build/intermediates/ndk/debug/obj/`（debug compilation) or `<project folder>/<Module>/build/intermediates/ndk/release/obj/`(release compile).
    
    The effect of the transformation is as follows:

        ```

=== "iOS"

    The `sourcemap` file on the iOS platform is a symbol table file with debugging information suffixed `.dSYM`. Typically, the project is compiled in the same directory as the `.app` file, as follows:
    
    ```
    $ ls -l Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/
    total 0
    drwxr-xr-x   6 zy  staff  192  8  9 15:27 Fishing.app
    drwxr-xr-x   3 zy  staff   96  8  9 14:02 Fishing.app.dSYM
    drwxr-xr-x  15 zy  staff  480  8  9 15:27 Fishing.doccarchive
    drwxr-xr-x   6 zy  staff  192  8  9 13:55 Fishing.swiftmodule
    ```
    
    Note that XCode Release builds the `.dSYM` file by default, while Debug compilation will not be generated by default, so you need to set XCode accordingly:
    
    ```
    Build Settings -> Code Generation -> Generate Debug Symbols -> Yes
    Build Settings -> Build Option -> Debug Information Format -> DWARF with dSYM File
    ```
    
    When packaging zip, you can package the corresponding `.dSYM` files into the zip package. If your project involves multiple `.dSYM` files, you need to package them together into the zip package, and then copy the zip package to the `<DataKit installation directory >/data/rum/ios` directory. The directory structure after zip package decompression is similar to the following (the`.dSYM` file is essentially a directory, which is similar to the executable program `.app` file under macOS):


    ```
    <app_id>-<env>-<version>/
    ├── AFNetworking.framework.dSYM
    │   └── Contents
    │       ├── Info.plist
    │       └── Resources
    │           └── DWARF
    │               └── AFNetworking
    └── App.app.dSYM
        └── Contents
            ├── Info.plist
            └── Resources
                └── DWARF
                    └── App
    
    ```

### File Upload and Delete {#upload-delete}

After packaging, in addition to manually copying to Datakit related directories, the file can also be uploaded and deleted through http interface, provided that Datakit starts DCA service.

Upload:

```shell
curl -X POST '<dca_address>/v1/rum/sourcemap?app_id=<app_id>&env=<env>&version=<version>&platform=<platform>' -F "file=@<sourcemap_path>" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```

Delete:

```shell
curl -X DELETE '<dca_address>/v1/rum/sourcemap?app_id=<app_id>&env=<env>&version=<version>&platform=<platform>'
```

Variable description:

- `<dca_address>`: DCA 服务的地址，如 `http://localhost:9531`
- `<app_id>`: 对应 RUM 的 `applicationId`
- `<env>`: 对应 RUM 的 `env`
- `<version>`: 对应 RUM 的 `version`
- `<platform>` 应用平台，当前支持 `web`/ `android` / `ios`
- `<sourcemap_path>`: 待上传的`sourcemap` 压缩包文件路径

???+ attention

    - This conversion process is only for the `error` measurement.
    - Currently only Javascript/Android/iOS sourcemap conversion is supported.
    - If the corresponding sourcemap file is not found, no conversion will be performed.
    - Sourcemap compressed package uploaded through the interface, which does not need to restart DataKit to take effect. However, if it is uploaded manually, you need to restart the DataKit before it can take effect.
