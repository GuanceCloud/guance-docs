# Host Installation
---

This article describes the basic installation of DataKit.

## Register/log in to Guance Cloud {#login-guance}

The browser visits the [Guance Cloud registration](https://auth.guance.com/redirectpage/register){:target="_blank"} portal, fills in the corresponding information, and then [logs in to Guance Cloud](https://console.guance.com/pageloading/login){:target="_blank"}.

## Get the Installation Command {#get-install}

Log in to the workspace, click "Integration" on the left and select "Datakit" at the top, and you can see the installation commands of various platforms.

> Note that the following Linux/Mac/Windows installer can automatically identify the hardware platform (arm/x86, 32bit/64bit) without making a hardware platform selection.

=== "Linux/macOS"

    The installation command supports `bash` and `ash`([:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.14.0](changelog.md#cl-1.14.0)), and the command is roughly as follows:

    - `bash`
    
    ```shell
    DK_DATAWAY=https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN> bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.guance.com/datakit/install.sh)" 
    ```
    
    - `ash`

    ```shell
    DK_DATAWAY=https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN> ash -c "$(curl -L https://static.guance.com/datakit/install.sh)"
    ```

    After the installation is completed, you will see a prompt that the installation is successful at the terminal.

=== "Windows"

    Installation on Windows requires a Powershell command line installation and must run Powershell as an administrator. Press the Windows key, enter powershell to see the pop-up powershell icon, and right-click and select "Run as an administrator".
    
    ```powershell
    Remove-Item -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue Env:DK_*;
    $env:DK_DATAWAY="https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN>";
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -scope Process -Force;
    Import-Module bitstransfer;
    start-bitstransfer  -source https://static.guance.com/datakit/install.ps1 -destination .install.ps1;
    powershell .install.ps1; 
    ```

### Install DataKit lite {#lite-install}

You can specify the environment variable `DK_LITE` to install DataKit lite ([:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.14.0](changelog.md#cl-1.14.0)):

=== "Linux/macOS"

    ```shell
    DK_DATAWAY=https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN> DK_LITE=1 bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.guance.com/datakit/install.sh)"
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
    Remove-Item -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue Env:DK_*;
    $env:DK_DATAWAY="https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN>";
    $env:DK_LITE="1";
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -scope Process -Force;
    Import-Module bitstransfer;
    start-bitstransfer  -source https://static.guance.com/datakit/install.ps1 -destination .install.ps1;
    powershell .install.ps1;
    ```

DataKit lite only contains collectors as below:

### Install Specific Version {#version-install}

We can install specific datakit version, for example 1.2.3:

```shell
DK_DATAWAY=https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN> bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.guance.com/datakit/install-1.2.3.sh)"
```

And the same as Windows:

```powershell
Remove-Item -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue Env:DK_*;
$env:DK_DATAWAY="https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN>";
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -scope Process -Force;
Import-Module bitstransfer;
start-bitstransfer  -source https://static.guance.com/datakit/install-1.2.3.ps1 -destination .install.ps1;
powershell .install.ps1;
```

## Additional Supported Installation Variable {#extra-envs}

If you need to define some DataKit configuration during the installation phase, you can add environment variables to the installation command, just append them before `DK_DATAWAY` For example, append the `DK_NAMESPACE` setting:

=== "Linux/macOS"

    ```shell
    DK_DATAWAY=https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN> DK_NAMESPACE=<namespace> bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.guance.com/datakit/install.sh)"
    ```
    
=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
    Remove-Item -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue Env:DK_*;
    $env:DK_DATAWAY="https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN>";
    $env:DK_NAMESPACE="<namespace>";
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -scope Process -Force;
    Import-Module bitstransfer;
    start-bitstransfer  -source https://static.guance.com/datakit/install.ps1 -destination .install.ps1;
    powershell .install.ps1;
    ```
---

The setting format of the two environment variables is:

```shell
# Windows: Multiple environment variables are divided by semicolons
$env:NAME1="value1"; $env:Name2="value2"

# Linux/Mac: Multiple environment variables are divided by spaces
NAME1="value1" NAME2="value2"
```

The environment variables supported by the installation script are as follows (supported by the whole platform).

???+ attention

    These environment variable settings are not supported for [full offline installation](datakit-offline-install.md#offline). However, these environment variables can be set by [proxy](datakit-offline-install.md#with-datakit) and [setting local installation address](datakit-offline-install.md#with-nginx).

### Most Commonly Used Environment Variables {#common-envs}

- `DK_DATAWAY`: Specify the DataWay address, and the DataKit installation command has been brought by default
- `DK_GLOBAL_TAGS`: Deprecated, DK_GLOBAL_HOST_TAGS instead
- `DK_GLOBAL_HOST_TAGS`: Support the installation phase to fill in the global host tag, format example: `host=__datakit_hostname,host_ip=__datakit_ip` (multiple tags are separated by English commas)
- `DK_GLOBAL_ELECTION_TAGS`: Support filling in the global election tag during the installation phase，format example: `project=my-porject,cluster=my-cluster` (support filling in the global election tag during the installation phase)
- `DK_DEF_INPUTS`: List of collector names opened by default, format example: `cpu,mem,disk`. We can also ban some default inputs by putting a `-` prefix at input name, such as `-cpu,-mem,-disk`. But if mixed them, such as `cpu,mem,-disk,-system`, we only accept the banned list, the effect is only `disk` and `system` disabled, but others enabled.
- `DK_CLOUD_PROVIDER`: Support filling in cloud vendors during installation (`aliyun/aws/tencent/hwcloud/azure`)
- `DK_LITE`： When installing the simplified DataKit, you can set this variable to `1`. ([:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.14.0](changelog.md#cl-1.14.0))

???+ tip "Disable all default inputs[:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.5.5](changelog.md#cl-1.5.5)"

    We can set `DK_DEF_INPUTS` to `-` to disable all default inputs:

    ```shell
    DK_DEF_INPUTS="-" \
    DK_DATAWAY=https://openway.guance.com?token=<TOKEN> \
    bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.guance.com/datakit/install.sh)"
    ```

    Beside, if Datakit has been installed before, we must delete all default inputs *.conf* files manually. During installing, Datakit able to add new inputs configure, not cant delete them.

### On DataKit's Own Log  {#env-logging}

- `DK_LOG_LEVEL`: Optional info/debug
- `DK_LOG`: If changed to stdout, the log will not be written to the file, but will be output by the terminal.
- `DK_GIN_LOG`: If changed to stdout, the log will not be written to the file, but will be output by the terminal.

### On DataKit pprof  {#env-pprof}

- `DK_ENABLE_PPROF`(deprecated): whether to turn on `pprof`
- `DK_PPROF_LISTEN`: `pprof` service listening address

> [:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.9.2](changelog.md#cl-1.9.2) enabled pprof by default.

### On DataKit Election  {#env-election}

- `DK_ENABLE_ELECTION`: Open the election, not by default. If you need to open it, give any non-empty string value to the environment variable. (eg `True`/`False`)
- `DK_NAMESPACE`: Supports namespaces specified during installation (for election)

- `DK_UPGRADE_IP_WHITELIST`: Starting from Datakit [1.5.9](changelog.md#cl-1.5.9), we can upgrade Datakit by access remote http API. This environment variable is used to set the IP whitelist of clients that can be accessed remotely(multiple IPs could be separated by commas `,`). Access outside the whitelist will be denied (default not restricted).
- `DK_HTTP_PUBLIC_APIS`: Specify which Datakit HTTP APIs can be accessed by remote, generally config combined with RUM input，support from Datakit [1.9.2](changelog.md#cl-1.9.2).

### On DCA  {#env-dca}
- `DK_DCA_ENABLE`: Support DCA service to be turned on during installation (not turned on by default)

## FAQ {#faq}

### :material-chat-question: How to Deal with the Unfriendly Host Name {#bad-hostname}

Because DataKit uses Hostname as the basis for data concatenation, in some cases, some host names are not very friendly, such as  `iZbp141ahn....`, but for some reasons, these host names cannot be modified, which brings some troubles to use. In DataKit, this unfriendly host name can be overwritten in the main configuration.

In `datakit.conf`, modify the following configuration and the DataKit will read `ENV_HOSTNAME` to overwrite the current real hostname:

```toml
[environments]
	ENV_HOSTNAME = "your-fake-hostname-for-datakit"
```

> Note: If a host has collected data for a period of time, after changing the host name, the historical data will no longer be associated with the new host name. Changing the host name is equivalent to adding a brand-new host.

### :material-chat-question: Issue on macOS installation {#mac-failed}

If it appears during the installation/upgrade process when installing on macOS:

```shell
"launchctl" failed with stderr: /Library/LaunchDaemons/cn.dataflux.datakit.plist: Service is disabled
# or
"launchctl" failed with stderr: /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.guance.datakit.plist: Service is disabled
```

Execute:

```shell
sudo launchctl enable system/datakit
```

Then execute the following command:

```shell
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/cn.dataflux.datakit.plist
# or
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.guance.datakit.plist
```
