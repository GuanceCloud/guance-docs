Apache collector can collect the number of requests, connections and others from Apache services, and collect indicators to Guance Cloud to help monitor and analyze various abnormal situations of Apache.

## Preconditions {#requirements}

- Apache version >= 2.4.46 (Unix)
- Typical Linux distributions come with Apache. [See](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi){:target="_blank"} for download.
- Default configuration path: `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`,`/etc/apache2/httpd.conf`
- Open Apache `mod_status` and add the followings in Apache profile:

```xml
<Location /server-status>
SetHandler server-status

Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from your_ip
</Location>
```

- Restart Apache

```shell
sudo apachectl restart
```

## Configuration {#config}

=== "Host installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/{{.Catalog}}` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `{{.InputName}}.conf.sample` and name it `{{.InputName}}.conf`. Examples are as follows:
    
    ```toml
    {{ CodeBlock .InputSample 4 }}
    ```
    
    After configuration, [restart DataKit](datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    The collector can now be turned on by [configMap injection collector configuration](datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).

## Measurement {#measurements}

For all of the following data collections, a global tag named  `host` is appended by default (the tag value is the host name of the DataKit); other tags can be specified in the configuration through `[inputs.apache.tags]`:

``` toml
 [inputs.apache.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```

{{ range $i, $m := .Measurements }}

### `{{$m.Name}}` {#{{$m.Name}}}

{{$m.Desc}}

- tag

{{$m.TagsMarkdownTable}}

- metric list

{{$m.FieldsMarkdownTable}}

{{ end }} 

## Log Collection {#logging}

To collect the Apache log, open  `files` in Apache.conf and write to the absolute path of the Apache log file. For example:

```toml
[[inputs.apache]]
  ...
  [inputs.apache.log]
    files = [
      "/var/log/apache2/error.log",
      "/var/log/apache2/access.log"
    ]
```

When log collection is turned on, logs with `apache` log (`source`) will be generated by default.

???+ attention

    DataKit must be installed on the host where Apache is located to collect Apache logs.
