# Network

---

The network module supports viewing network traffic between hosts, Pods, Deployments, and Services. Based on the server and client side, it monitors network traffic and data connections from source IP to destination IP, providing real-time visualization to help enterprises understand their business system's network operation status in real time. This allows for rapid analysis, tracking, and pinpointing of issues, preventing or avoiding business problems caused by decreased network performance or interruptions.

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s network module contains three main sections: [Summary](#host), [Service Map](#map), and [Network Flow](#netflow), offering a comprehensive analysis of real-time network data.

## Prerequisites

You need to first register and log in to <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, then install DataKit on your host [Install DataKit](../datakit/datakit-install.md) and enable the [eBPF collector](../integrations/ebpf.md).

![](img/net-3.png)

### Quick Filters

On the summary pageâ€™s left side, quick filters primarily include transmission direction, transmission protocol, host, PID, and fields related to clients and servers:

![](img/net-4.png)

???+ info "Combination of Transmission Direction and Protocol"

    Currently supports network performance monitoring based on TCP and UDP protocols. Combined with incoming and outgoing, there are six combination options:

    incoming + no protocol distinction  
    incoming + TCP protocol  
    incoming + UDP protocol  
    outgoing + no protocol distinction

![](img/net-5.png)

> For more details, refer to [How to Use the Time Widget](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#time).

### List Details

Taking the host network as an example, after successful data collection, network performance monitoring data is reported to the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console. Clicking on a network data entry in the list opens the details page where you can view all network performance monitoring data within the workspace, including top-level client and server transmission directions, analysis charts, and network connection analysis.

![](img/net-6.png)

To avoid query failures due to excessive return query counts, you can choose to **statistically aggregate by IP dimension** the current data.

![](img/net-8.png)

???+ warning

    - Currently only supports Linux systems, and except for CentOS 7.6+ and Ubuntu 16.04, other distributions require a Linux kernel version higher than 4.0.0;

    - Host network traffic data is retained for the last 48 hours by default, while the Free Plan retains data for the last 24 hours;

    - In the host details page, clicking into **Network**, the [time widget](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#time) defaults to fetching data from the past 15 minutes and does not support auto-refresh; manual refresh is required to fetch new data.

> The details page also includes operations such as time widget, search, bind built-in views, export, etc., refer to [Using the Details Page Effectively](../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md).

#### Pod, Deployment, Service Data Details

In the details page, you can view the corresponding object names and switch between L4 and L7 networks for data viewing.

#### Network Connection Analysis {#connect}

In the details page > Network Connection Analysis, you can further examine network connection data, including client, server, transmission direction, sent bytes, received bytes, TCP delay, TCP retransmission count, etc.

Additionally, you can customize displayed fields via the **Settings** button or add filter conditions for keyword fields of string type. If you need to view more detailed network connection data, clicking on the data will display its corresponding network flow data.

## Topology {#map}

Click into **Infrastructure > Network > Topology** to view the upstream and downstream distribution of the network.

- Host Nodes:

    - Host node icons are divided into regular hosts and cloud hosts, with cloud hosts displaying the logo of the cloud service provider.

    - Host node edge colors show corresponding segment colors based on the numeric values of the filled fields and custom ranges.

    - Host nodes are connected by lines indicating network traffic. The lines are bidirectional curves showing incoming/outgoing traffic from the source host to the target host.

    - Host node sizes are determined by the inbound traffic volume of the current node.

    - Host node line thicknesses are determined by the size of the inbound and outbound traffic data.

- Custom Range: You can enable **Custom Range** to define a custom legend color range for the selected fill metric. The legend colors are divided into five intervals based on the maximum and minimum values, each automatically corresponding to five different colors. Lines and nodes outside the data range are grayed out.

- Mouse Hover: Hovering over a host node displays sent bytes, received bytes, TCP delay, TCP jitter, TCP retransmission count, TCP connection attempts, and TCP closures.

**Note**: If the target host is not in the current workspace but the target domain exists and the target domain port is less than 10000, the target domain will be displayed in the topology map.

### Associated Analysis

Click on the icon of the host/Pod/Deployment/Services, then click **View Upstream/Downstream** to view the upstream/downstream nodes associated with the current node. You can also view details, related logs, related traces, and related events for the host/Pod/Deployment/Services, and navigate accordingly.

![](img/4.network_9.png)

Click the **Return to Summary** in the upper-left corner to return to the original network map. Searching or filtering in the search box filters associated upstream/downstream nodes, displaying matching nodes based on the search or filter results.

## Network Flow Data {#netflow}

As mentioned earlier, you can [view network flow data in the list details page](#connect). Additionally, in the **Summary** or **Topology** pages, click **View Network Flow Data** in the upper-right corner to navigate to the corresponding page. You can view L4 (netflow) and L7 (httpflow) network flow data on the timeline. All network flow data automatically refreshes every 30 seconds, defaulting to the most recent 15 minutes of data.

Switch between **L4 Network Flow** and **L7 Network Flow** at the top to view data under different schedules.
