## Step 2: Activate <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Commercial Plan

Clicking next will automatically redirect you to the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> activation page. If your current AWS account is not linked to a <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Center account, two scenarios may occur:

:material-numeric-1-circle-outline: [No Billing Center Account](#register): You need to register for a <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> account and a Billing Center account, then link the cloud account for billing;
