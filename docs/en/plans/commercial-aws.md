## Step Two: Activate <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Commercial Plan

Clicking this will automatically redirect you to the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> activation page. If your current AWS account is not linked to a <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Center account, there are two scenarios:

:material-numeric-1-circle-outline: [No Billing Center Account](#register): You need to register for a <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> account and Billing Center account, then implement cloud account binding for billing;

:material-numeric-2-circle-outline: [Billing Center Account Exists](#bond): You can directly bind the Billing Center account to enable cloud account billing.

    The overall process reference is as follows:
