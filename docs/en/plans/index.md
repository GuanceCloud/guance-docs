# Getting Started with Observation

## How is the traffic generated in the workspace settled?

When invoking various services within the workspace, corresponding traffic data will be generated. The settlement of this part involves two processes:

:material-numeric-1-circle: Statistics on the scale of data volume generated by the workspace.  
:material-numeric-2-circle: Generating billing details based on actual traffic.

Traffic data is generated within the workspace and **stored separately at the workspace level, and synchronized to the Billing Center to generate bills**.

Therefore: these two processes are independently carried out in the workspace and the Billing Center, and fee synchronization is achieved by associating the Billing Center account ID.

## Two accounts required for billing settlement


:material-numeric-1-circle: <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Console Account: Bound to the workspace, it collects statistics such as data volume access scale and billing details under this account; can be synchronized to a specified Billing Center account.

:material-numeric-2-circle: <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Center Account: Can be bound to one/multiple workspaces to achieve unified cost management.

**Note**: Workspaces can be billed individually, or multiple workspaces can be bound together for joint billing.

### Why are two accounts needed?

The settlement process mainly includes two aspects. On one hand, creating a workspace under the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console account and storing and collecting statistics on data traffic within that workspace. On the other hand, binding the Billing Center account with the workspace to obtain the billing data corresponding to that workspace, and finally settling according to the method selected by the user.

## Frequently Asked Questions

:material-chat-question: What's the difference between opening <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> service on the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> official website and through cloud vendors?

Both channels can normally activate <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> services, and the main difference lies in the **flexibility of choosing the settlement method after activating the service**.

- When activating on the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> official website, you can choose either the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Center or cloud vendor account for settlement;
- When activating through a specific cloud vendor, you can only settle with that cloud vendor's account.

So, if you already have a preferred settlement method, you can choose the activation channel based on the settlement method.


:material-chat-question: How do Billing Center accounts bind with workspaces?

- If you're a new registered user, during the registration process on the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> official website, you will simultaneously create the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console account, Billing Center account, and workspace, and the workspace will automatically bind to the account.

- If you're settling through a cloud vendor channel, after successfully ordering <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> service through the cloud vendor, there will be a workflow to bind the workspace, allowing you to select available workspaces to bind as per your needs.


:material-chat-question: Why is it necessary to use two accounts?

Workspaces are created under the console account, and when workspaces undergo fee settlement, they can consolidate settlements across multiple workspaces. Since these two processes operate independently, two accounts are needed for separate management.


:material-chat-question: How do I confirm whether I have a <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console account and a Billing Center account?

The <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> console account is used for logging into the official website: https://<<< custom_key.brand_main_domain >>>. **The unique credential for the account is the email address**.

Billing Center accounts can be viewed under **<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Workspace > Plans and Billing**. If there is a Billing Center account, the settlement account can be displayed normally; or you can log directly into the Billing Center platform: https://<<< custom_key.boss_domain >>>. **The unique credential for the Billing Center account is the username**.


:material-chat-question: I've activated the Free Plan of <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, how do I upgrade to the Commercial Plan?

Refer to the [documentation](./trail.md).
