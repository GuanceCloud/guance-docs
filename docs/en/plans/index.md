# Getting Started with Guance

## How is the traffic generated in the workspace billed?

When calling various services within the workspace, corresponding traffic data is generated. This billing process involves two procedures:

:material-numeric-1-circle: Statistics on the scale of data volume generated by the workspace.  
:material-numeric-2-circle: Generating detailed billing statements based on actual traffic.

Traffic data is generated within the workspace and **stored separately on a per-workspace basis, synchronized to the Billing Center to generate invoices**.

Therefore: these two processes are independently conducted in the workspace and the Billing Center, respectively, achieving cost synchronization through the association of the Billing Center account ID.

## Two Accounts Required for Billing


:material-numeric-1-circle: Guance Console Account: Bound to the workspace, it tracks data volume access scale and detailed billing under this account; can be synchronized to a specified Billing Center account.

:material-numeric-2-circle: Guance Billing Center Account: Can be bound to one or multiple workspaces, enabling unified cost management.

**Note**: Workspaces can be billed individually or multiple workspaces can be bound together for joint billing.

### Why Are Two Accounts Needed?

The billing process mainly includes two aspects. On one hand, creating workspaces under the Guance console account and performing data traffic storage and statistics within that workspace. On the other hand, binding the Billing Center account to the workspace to obtain the billing data corresponding to the workspace, and finally settling according to the user's chosen method.

## FAQs

:material-chat-question: What is the difference between registering Guance service on the official website and through cloud providers?

Both channels can activate the Guance service normally, the main difference lies in the **billing method options after activation**.

- When registering on the Guance official website, you can choose to settle via the Guance Billing Center or cloud provider accounts;
- When activating through the respective cloud provider, you can only settle using that cloud provider's account.

Therefore, if you already have a preferred billing method, you can choose the registration channel based on your billing preference.


:material-chat-question: How do I bind the Billing Center account to the workspace?

- If you are a new user, during the registration process on the Guance official website, you will simultaneously create the Guance console account, Billing Center account, and workspace, which will automatically be bound.

- If you are settling through a cloud provider channel, after successfully subscribing to the Guance service via the cloud provider, there will be a process to bind the workspace, allowing you to select available workspaces as needed.


:material-chat-question: Why are two accounts required?

Workspaces are created under the console account, and when workspaces undergo fee settlements, multiple workspaces can be consolidated for billing. Since these two processes are handled separately, two accounts are required for separate management.


:material-chat-question: How do I check if I have a Guance console account and a Billing Center account?

The Guance console account is used for logging into the official website: https://<<< custom_key.brand_main_domain >>>. **The unique identifier for the account is the email address**.

The Billing Center account can be viewed in **Guance Workspace > Paid Plans & Billing**. If there is a Billing Center account, the settlement account will display normally; or log in directly to the Billing Center platform: https://boss.guance.com. **The unique identifier for the Billing Center account is the username**.
