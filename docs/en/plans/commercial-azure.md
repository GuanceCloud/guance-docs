## Activating <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Commercial Plan

After clicking, you will be automatically redirected to the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> activation page. If your current Microsoft Cloud account is not linked to a <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Center account, two scenarios may occur:

:material-numeric-1-circle-outline: [No Billing Center Account](#register): You need to register for a <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> account and a Billing Center account, then bind the cloud account for billing;

:material-numeric-2-circle-outline: [Has Billing Center Account](#bond): You can directly bind the Billing Center account to enable cloud account billing.

If you already have a Billing Center account, click next to go directly to the binding page:
