# Pie Chart
---

## Introduction

Pie charts are generally suitable for showing comparisons of data groupings.


## Application Scenarios

The pie chart of the Guance is used to show the comparison of data groupings. For example you can see how the used space on the disk compares to the remaining space.

## Chart Query

Chart query supports 「simple query」, 「expression query」 and 「DQL query」, please click [chart-query](chart-query.md) for detailed explanation of chart query conditions.

## Chart Links

Links can help you realize jumping from the current chart to the target page, support adding platform internal links and external links, support modifying the corresponding variable values in the links through template variables to transfer data information over and complete data linkage.Please click [chart-link] to view the relevant settings.
## Chart Style
| Options | Description                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Chart Title | Set the title name for the chart, after setting, it will be displayed on the top left of the chart, and it supports hiding |
| Chart Type | <li>Pie chart: shows the comparison of data grouping, more often used in scenarios with fewer sample metrics<br /><li>Ring chart: more suitable for reflecting the proportion of each part of multiple sample metrics<br /><li>Rose chart: the size of the radius of the arc indicates the size of the data, suitable for scenarios reflecting too much classification, and the proportion of similar numerical size and comparison scenarios |
| 图例 | Used to visually display the name, quantity and percentage of each metric data. Currently supports selecting the bottom, right, wrap around, and hide legends (click on the metric row in the legend to hide/show the corresponding metric) |
| Alias | <li>Supports adding aliases to grouped queries. After adding aliases, the name of the legend changes, making it easier to distinguish related metrics more intuitively.<br/><li>Support custom manual input of preset aliases, input format: aggregation function(metric){"tag": "tag value"}, such as `last(usage_idle){"host": "guance_01"}` |
| Color     | Set the chart data display color, support custom manual input preset color, input format: aggregation function (metric) {"label": "label value"}, such as `last(usage_idle){"host": "guance_01"}` |
| Show groups only | The default is off, and when it is on, only 「tag values」 will be displayed in the legend, no more aggregated functions and metric names, etc. |

## Chart Setup

### Basic Settings
| Options | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | 1.Support setting units for query results.<br />1）If the queried data has no unit, after setting the unit in the chart, it will be displayed on the chart according to the set unit<br />2）If the query data comes with its own units, or if you are in [Metric Management] (../../metrics/dictionary.md), and you set the units for the metrics in the chart, the units set in the chart will be displayed on the chart.<br />3）If the queried data has no units and no units are set in the chart, the chart Y-axis values are automatically calculated according to scientific notation；The raw values are displayed on the chart in the format [thousandths](chart-query.md#thousand).<br /> **Scientific counting instructions**<br />Default query result value is automatically converted to units, display follows 「scientific notation K, M, B」 (1 thousand = 1K, 1 million = 1M, 1 billion = 1B), retaining two decimal points; RMB is automatically converted to units 「yuan, million, billion」, retaining two decimal points<br />*For example, if the unit of time interval is selected as ns, then according to the size of the data, the query result will only automatically convert the unit effect as follows, and so on：*<br /><li>1000000ns：Chart query data results in 1ms<br /><li>1000000000ns：The chart query data result shows 1s<br /><li>10000000000ns：The chart query data result shows 1m<br /><br/>2.Support for query results preset units, manual input format: aggregation function (metric), such as `last(age_idle)` |

### Advanced Settings
| Options | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Time slice | When time slicing is turned on, the original data will be first aggregated in segments at certain time intervals, and then the aggregated data set will be aggregated a second time to get the result value, which is turned off by default.For details, see [time slicing instructions](chart-query.md#time-slicing) |
| Lock time | Support locking the time range of the chart query data, not limited by the global time component. The time set by the user will appear in the upper right corner of the chart after successful setup, e.g. 【xx minutes】, 【xx hours】, 【xx days】. If the time interval is locked at 30 minutes, then when adjusting the time component, no matter what time range view is queried, only the last 30 minutes of data will be displayed. |
| Time interval | If the time slice is off, there is no time interval option, if the time slice is on, the time interval option is as follows：<br /><li>Original interval: default query to display data according to the time range of the time component<br /><li>Auto-alignment: When turned on, the query will be dynamically adjusted according to the selected time range and aggregation interval, rounded upward according to the calculated time interval in close proximity.（ For example, if the automatic aggregation algorithm calculates the time interval to be 50 seconds, then the actual query will be launched at an interval of 1 minute ）The system is preset with 1 ms, 10 ms, 50 ms, 100 ms, 500 ms, 1 sec, 5 sec, 15 sec, 30 sec, 1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and many other time intervals.<br /><li>Custom time interval: When 【Lock time】 is selected, different optional time intervals will be automatically matched to query the displayed data according to the length of lock time.（ For example, if you select 1 minute for the time interval, then the query will actually be launched at 1 minute intervals ）<br /> |
| Field Mapping | The object mapping function with view variables is off by default, if object mapping is configured in the view variables：<br /><li>When field mapping is enabled, the chart displays the 「grouped fields」 of the query and the corresponding 「mapped fields」, and the grouped fields without specified mapping are not displayed.<br /><li>When field mapping is turned off, the chart is displayed normally, without the mapped fields<br /> |
| Chart Description | Add description information for the chart, after setting the chart title will appear behind the 【i】 prompt, not set, it will not be displayed |
| Workspace | A list of authorized workspaces, which can be queried and displayed via charts after selection |
