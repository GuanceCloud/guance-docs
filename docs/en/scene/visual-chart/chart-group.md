# Chart grouping
---

## Brief introduction

Guance supports dividing charts of scene views into different groups, helping users to categorize and manage visual charts and quickly compare monitoring results.

## Creating a grouping

Open the chart 「Add Chart」 and select 「Grouping」 in the chart to create a new group in the node view.

Select 「Settings」 in the grouping to choose to modify/delete the combination. Support only delete grouping and keep the original chart under default grouping.

## Drag-and-drop grouping

You can drag and drop by clicking the drag and drop icon on the far right when the group is tucked away.
