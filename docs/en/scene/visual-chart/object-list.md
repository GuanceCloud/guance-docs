| Lock Time | Fixes the time range for the current chart query data, independent of the global time component. After successful setup, the user-defined time will appear in the top-right corner of the chart, such as 【xx minutes】, 【xx hours】, 【xx days】. If the locked time interval is 30 minutes, then regardless of the time range selected by adjusting the time component, only the data from the last 30 minutes will be displayed. |
