# Default Links

Default links are automatically provided by the system for charts. Based on the current query's time range and grouping tags, they help you quickly view related logs, processes, containers, traces, etc.

After enabling the display of built-in links, clicking on the chart will allow you to view associated data.

As shown in the figure below, after enabling "View Related Logs," the system will associate and query relevant logs based on the current query's grouping tags, adding the current grouping tags as filtering conditions and supporting redirection to the log viewer for detailed information. The method for viewing data such as containers, processes, and traces is similar.
