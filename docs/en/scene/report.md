???+ warning "Note"

    - The modified view variables here apply only to the generated report and do not affect the original default configuration of the dashboard;
    - If the dashboard does not define any view variables, this option will not be displayed.

### Scheduling Plan

1. Time Zone: Default display is `UTC+08:00`, modification is temporarily unsupported.               
2. Report Time: Set the specific time for sending the scheduled report. Enter positive integers within the following ranges: hour 0-23; minute 0-59.               
3. Report Cycle: Set the frequency of sending scheduled reports. Options include:

    - Daily: Choose to send every day or specify certain dates (multiple selections supported);
    - Weekly: Choose the frequency based on the weekly time dimension;
    - Monthly: Choose to send every month or specify certain months and dates (multiple selections supported).              

### Notification Methods

Currently supports 5 types of notifications: email groups, DingTalk bots, WeCom bots, Lark bots, Webhook.

1. Notification Targets: Recipients of the current scheduled report. You can create new notification targets in [Monitoring > Notification Targets Management](../monitoring/notify-object.md);               
2. Title: The name displayed in the email for the scheduled report.               
3. Content: The specific content displayed in the email for the scheduled report.               


### Sharing Methods

1. Image: Choose the image format for sharing the scheduled report, including dashboard screenshots or chart screenshots.
        
    - Email/DingTalk bot notifications: By default, the dashboard content is exported as an image. If the data query time range of the dashboard is too long, contains too much data, or includes complex calculations, it may result in blank charts.
    - WeCom bot: Supports default mode and image mode (under this mode, only images can be shared, text cannot be sent, and the image size should be limited to within 2MB)
    - Webhook: Supports sharing image links, accessible via the link to the dashboard image.

2. Sharing Method:

    - Public Sharing: Short links for publicly shared scheduled reports can be opened directly;

    - Encrypted Sharing: Requires setting a 4ï½ž8 character password using English letters and numbers. After completion, the correct password must be entered to open the short link of the scheduled report.
