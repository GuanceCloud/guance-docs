The scene takes charts as the main body, and supports a series of functional operations such as custom editing and filtering to visually reproduce the details of data insight. It mainly includes three functions: [dashboards](./dashboard.md), [notes](./note.md) and [explorers](./explorer/index.md). 
 
As you can see, Guance has offered over 100 data monitoring view templates, of which users can import templates to create dashboards and viewers, and make custom editing configurations; Or choose a custom creation method to build a data insight scenario through a series of settings. At the same time, in order to keep abnormal data analysis, notes support users to import charts and text documents to trace back, locate and solve data problems. 


## Dashboard
