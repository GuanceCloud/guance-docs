The scene takes charts as the main body, supporting a range of custom editing and filtering operations to visually reproduce data insights in detail.
 
As you can see, Guance has offered [over 100 data monitoring view templates](./built-in-view/index.md), which can be imported by users to create dashboards and explorers, and can be customized and edited. Alternatively, users can choose to create their own custom templates by configuring a series of settings to build data insight scenes.
