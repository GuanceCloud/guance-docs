In the Observation Cloud, you can build 「 scene 」 to meet different business based on different perspectives. Scenarios include dashboards, notes, and viewers.

## Dashboard

Under Scene, you can create multiple [dashboards](dashboard.md) to build data insight scenarios. Adding multiple visual charts for data presentation is supported in the dashboard to help users visually track, analyze and display key performance indicators and monitor the overall operational status.

## Built-in view
The [built-in-view](built-in-in-view/index.md) is a view template recorded in the "Guance Cloud" platform, including both system view and user view types, you can apply the system view directly to the scenario or customize it as a new built-in view.
