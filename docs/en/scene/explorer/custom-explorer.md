# Quick Setup of Custom Explorer
---

The Explorer, as an important tool for observability, supports us in quickly locating issues through search, filtering, and other methods. <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, based on the existing Explorer, **supports creating custom Explorers within scenes**.

Custom Explorers adopt a brand-new unified layout, responsive configuration mode, and more scientific data association settings. You can experience the following features in a custom Explorer:

- Multiple custom chart display settings;
- Custom quick filter fields;
- Custom default columns for list display;
- Binding with associated built-in views.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the **Scene > Explorer** page, click **Create**, and enter the creation page.

**Note**: If you set indexes under **Logs > Index**, you can choose different log contents corresponding to various indexes in the custom Explorer.
