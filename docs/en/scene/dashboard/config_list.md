# Manag List

For all dashboards within the current workspace, you can manage them through the following options.

## Batch Options

Select dashboards for batch deletion, export, and modification of visibility.

**Note**:

1. The home dashboard does not support modifying visibility.
2. Dashboards not created by yourself do not support modifying the visibility to "Only visible to me" here.

## Modify/Export/Delete

Click to modify the name, export the dashboard to a JSON file, and delete the dashboard.

## Set as Home Dashboard

Set a dashboard as the workspace-level **Home Dashboard**. Once set, it will be displayed by default when subsequent members visit the workspace.

**Note**: Only dashboards with "Public" visibility can be set as the **Home Dashboard**, and after setting, the visibility cannot be modified.

## Filter/Search

On the left side of the dashboard, you can quickly filter and search for corresponding dashboards through different categories.

You can also quickly filter dashboards by setting tags for them.
