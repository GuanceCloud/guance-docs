# List Management

For all dashboards within the current workspace, you can manage them through the following operations.

## Batch operations

After selecting dashboards, you can perform batch deletion, export, and modify visibility scope operations.

???+ warning "Note"

    - The home dashboard does not support modifying the visibility scope.
    - Dashboards not created by the user do not support changing the scope to "Visible only to myself" here.

## Modify/Export/Delete {#options}

Click the dashboard :material-dots-vertical: button to perform the following operations:
    
- Modify the dashboard name;
- Export the dashboard as a JSON file;
- Delete the dashboard.

## Set Home Dashboard

This involves setting the dashboard as the workspace-level "Home Dashboard". After completing the setup, when members subsequently access this space, the home dashboard will be displayed by default.

**Note**: Only supports setting the "Home Dashboard" for dashboards that are "Publicly visible", and after setting it, modifying the visibility scope is not supported.

## Filtering/Sorting

On the left side of the dashboard, you can quickly filter and search for corresponding dashboards through different categories, or you can set tags for the dashboard to enable quick filtering.


| Category      | Description         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| My Favorites      | Dashboards favorited by the current user; click the dashboard :octicons-star-24: favorite icon.         |
| Imported Projects      | Dashboards created by importing custom templates.         |
| My Creations      | All dashboards created by the current user, including imported dashboards.         |

| Frequently Browsed      | Dashboards viewed more than 5 times in the past week by the current user.         |
