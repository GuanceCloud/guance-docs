Webhook custom notification type `HTTPRequest` sends a plain text POST request to the specified address.  

Assuming the user-configured address is `[http://my-system/accept-webhook](http://my-system/accept-webhook)`, the resulting alarm header and content are:  

Title: 

```
There is a problem with your ECS 
```

Content:

```
Your ECS has the following issues:
- High CPU utilization (92%)
- Overused memory (81%)
```

The requests sent will vary according to the type of request configured:

1）When `bodyType` is not specified or `text`, the request details are as follows:

```http
POST http://my-system/accept-webhook
Content-Type: text/plain

There is a problem with your ECS

Your ECS has the following issues:
- High CPU utilization （92%）
- Overused memory (81%）
```

Where 1st is the event header `df_title`, 2nd is a blank line, and everything thereafter is the event content`df_message`。

2）When `bodyType` is `json`, the request details are as follows:

```http
POST http://my-system/accept-webhook
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "timestamp"               : 1625638440,
    "df_status"               : "warning",
    "df_event_id"             : "event-xxxxxxxxxx",
    "df_title"                : "web001存在问题",
    "df_message"              : "web001存在问题\nCPU使用率大于90\n内存使用率大于90",
    "df_dimension_tags"       : "{\"host\":\"web001\"}",
    "df_monitor_id"           : "monitor_xxxxxxxxxx",
    "df_monitor_name"         : "异常检测名",
    "df_monitor_checker_id"   : "rul_xxxxxxxxxx",
    "df_monitor_checker_name" : "异常检测项目名",
    "df_monitor_checker_value": "99",
    "df_event_link"           : "https://console.guance.com/keyevents/monitorChart?xxxxxxxxxx"
    "df_workspace_uuid"       : "wksp_xxxxxxxxxx",
    "df_workspace_name"       : "我的工作空间",
    "Result"                  : 99,
    "...其他更多字段": "略",

    // 以下为旧版字段
    "date"          : 1625638440,
    "workspace_uuid": "wksp_xxxxxxxxxx",
    "workspace_name": "我的工作空间",
}
```
