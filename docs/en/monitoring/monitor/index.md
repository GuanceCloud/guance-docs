# Monitor
---

Guance supports self-built monitors, including threshold detection, log detection, mutation detection, interval detection, water level detection, security detection, application performance metric detection, user access metric detection, process anomaly detection, infrastructure survival detection, usability monitoring and network data detection. The user is allowed to configure the detection rules and trigger conditions. After the monitor is turned on, the relevant abnormal event alarm triggered by the detection rules can be received.

## Introduction

All monitors in the workspace can be viewed and managed through the "monitoring" of the "Guance" platform. You can not only create new monitors, but also manage, delete, batch, and so on existing alert policies and monitors.

## New Monitor

Guance enables you to quickly create monitors from host, Docker, Elasticsearch and other monitoring templates, or customize new monitors and trigger conditions and configure alarms.

### New from Template

Guance has built-in a variety of out-of-the-box monitoring templates, which support one-click creation of host, Docker, Elasticsearch, Redis, Alibaba Cloud RDS, Alibaba Cloud SLB, Flink monitoring and so on. That is, the corresponding official monitor is automatically added to the current workspace. Refer to the documentation [Templates](../template.md) for details.

Note: Repeatedly creating monitors from templates will cause duplicate monitors in the monitor list. Guance supports detecting duplicate monitors. You can create all monitors in the template library normally by selecting "Yes" in the pop-up prompt, or select "No" to create only non-duplicate monitors.

### New Monitor

In the monitor, it is supported to add a new monitor through "+ New Monitor" and customize the trigger rules.

- [Threshold Detection](threshold-detection.md): Anomaly detection is carried out on metric data based on the set threshold, and when the data reaches the threshold, an alarm is triggered and the user is notified.
- [Log Detection](log-detection.md): Anomaly detection based on log data in workspace, which is mostly suitable for code anomaly or task scheduling detection in IT monitoring scenarios.
- [Mutation Detection](mutation-detection.md): Based on comparing the absolute or relative (%) changes of the same metric in two different time periods, it is judged whether an abnormal situation occurs. Most of them are used to track the peak value or data change of a certain metric, and when abnormal situations occur, events can be generated more accurately and kept for records.
- [Interval Detection](interval-detection.md): Anomaly detection is done based on the metric data within the selected detection interval time range, which is mostly used to monitor the data/metrics with stable trend.
- [Outlier Detection](outlier-detection.md): Based on the algorithm, detect whether there is outlier deviation in the metric/statistical data of the detected objects under a specific group.
- [Security Check](security_checker.md): Anomaly detection based on security check data in workspace, which is used to monitor vulnerabilities, anomalies and risks in systems, containers and networks in workspace.
- [Application Performance Metric Detection](application-performance-detection.md): Based on the metric data of "application performance monitoring" in the workspace, an alarm is triggered when the metric reaches the set threshold range.
- [User Access Metric Detection](real-user-detection.md): Based on the metric data of "User Access Monitoring" in the workspace, an alarm is triggered when the metric reaches the set threshold range.
-  [Process Anomaly Detection](processes-detection.md): Used to monitor process data in the workspace and support setting triggering alarms for one or more field types of process data.
- [Infrastructure Survival Detection](infrastructure-detection.md): Used to monitor the health of the infrastructure.
- [Availability Monitoring Data Detection](usability-detection.md): Based on the cloud dialing data in the workspace, an alarm is triggered by setting a threshold range for the specified data amount generated by dialing tasks within a certain period of time.
- [Network Data Detection](network-detection.md): Used to monitor the metric data of "network performance monitoring" in the workspace. By setting the threshold range, an alarm is triggered when the metric reaches the threshold.

## Alarm Policy Management

The alarm policy function supports you to customize and create meaningful monitor combinations when setting monitors, and supports filtering out corresponding monitors through "alarm policy", which is convenient for alarm policy to manage various monitors.
Note:

- When each monitor is created, an alarm policy must be selected, and "Default" is selected by default;
- When an alarm policy is deleted, the monitor under the deleted alarm policy will be automatically classified under "Default".

### New Alarm Policy

In the Guance workspace "Monitoring"-"Alarm Policy Management", click "New Alarm Policy" to add a new alarm policy. You can configure alarm objects and alarm silences for alarm policies. See the documentation [alarm policy](../alert-setting.md).

### Configure Monitor Alarm Policy

创建告警策略以后，可以为监视器选择告警策略。在观测云工作空间「监控」-「监控器」，点击「新建监控器」，即可在创建监控器时选择告警策略。

## 监控器列表

In the "Monitors" list, all monitors in the current workspace are saved. It supports for viewing monitor names, alert policies, status, actions, and whether they are added to the SLO's list of SLI targets. Monitors added to SLO as SLI will be displayed with special identity.

### Query

The monitor list supports searching based on monitor name and alarm policy name.

- Search box🔍 supports monitor name and alarm policy name search;
- Select "Alarm Policy" to support filtering out the corresponding monitor based on the specified alarm policy.

### Bulk Operation

The "Bulk Operation" function supports users to "Bulk Export Monitor" and "Bulk Delete Monitor" in the monitor list. By selecting a batch operation, you can select multiple monitors for deletion and import at the same time.

### Import/Export Monitor {#management}

Support "import/export monitor" in "monitor", that is, create monitor by importing/exporting monitor configuration json file. The imported json files will be imported directly as monitors and grouped by default.

**Note**: The imported json file needs to be the configuration json file from Guance.

## Operating Instructions
| **Operation** | **Instructions** |
| --- | --- |
| Status | The status of the current monitor has been enabled/disabled, and the monitor can be enabled or disabled through the operation bar; |
| Enable/Disable | Guance supports enabling/disabling existing monitors. The newly created monitor will start by default, and you can "disable" the monitor or restart the disabled monitor.<br>**Note**: "Disabled" monitors will no longer take effect; Disabled monitors can be reopened by "Enable". |
| Test | Guance supports manual trigger monitor detection. If the current detection rule triggers, you can view the relevant details in the event explorer.<br>**Note**: For the convenience of testing the monitor, manually triggered events are not affected by "alarm silence" (that is, as long as it is manually triggered, an alarm notification will be sent).<br>Silence rules are not affected and objects specified as silent are still skipped. |
| Edit | Guance supports re-editing the existing monitor, and the trigger conditions of the monitor can be re-edited by clicking the monitor name or "Edit".|
| Delete | Guance supports "deletion" of existing monitors. When a monitor is not needed, you can delete the corresponding monitor by using the Delete button.<br>**Note**: Once the monitor is deleted, the monitor data cannot be recovered and the event data remains. |
| View Related Events | Alarm events triggered by the same monitor are uniformly stored under the corresponding "monitor", and all unrecovered events triggered by this rule can be directly jumped through the operation of "View Related Events". For details, please refer to [event Management](../../events/explorer.md). |
| View related views (related dashboard) | Each monitor supports associating a dashboard. Edit the monitor, and then associate the corresponding dashboard through the "Associating Dashboard" function. |
