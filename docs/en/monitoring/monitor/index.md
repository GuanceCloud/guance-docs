# Monitors
---

You can quickly create monitors through the following methods:

- [Use out-of-the-box monitoring templates](../monitor/template.md): Includes various official built-in monitoring templates, supporting one-click creation of monitors for HOSTs, Docker, Elasticsearch, Redis, Alibaba Cloud RDS, Alibaba Cloud SLB, Flink, and more.  
- [Customize a new monitor](./monitor-rule.md): Through more than ten detection rules such as threshold detection, log detection, mutation detection, interval detection, etc., define the trigger conditions for custom monitors. After enabling the monitor, you will receive alerts for related anomaly events.


## Functional Extensions

Save as a custom template: Save already created monitors as a [template](../monitor/custom-template.md) for easy addition or deletion of monitor configuration conditions later.
