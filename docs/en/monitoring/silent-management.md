# Silent Management
---

## Introduction

"Silence management" is to manage all silence rules in the current space. It supports silent management of different monitors, intelligent inspection, self-built inspection, SLO and alarm policies, so that silent objects do not send alarm notifications to any alarm notification objects during silent time.

- Silent range: Silent range is set as "monitoring object that stops sending alarm notification" in silent task. Support the selection of relevant monitors, intelligent inspection, self-built inspection, SLO and alarm policies as silent objects, and the alarms generated by silent objects will not be sent to the corresponding alarm notifiers. Multiple selection of silent objects is supported. Drop-down box Click the content on the right to support a new page to jump to the details page to view the details.

???+ warning

    Silence range is required, label is not required. Silence will only take effect if the conditions of "Silence Range" and "Label" are met at the same time. Examples are as follows:

    Assume that "Monitor A" and "Smart Inspection B" are selected for the silent range, and "host:aaa" and "city:Shanghai" are selected for the tabs. When the three conditions of Monitor A, host:aaa and city: Shanghai are met at the same time, the notification is silent; When the three conditions of intelligent inspection B, host:aaa and city: Shanghai are met at the same time, the notification is silent.

- Silence time: Support user-defined start time and end time of alarm silence, no alarm information will be sent within the set time range, and support quick setting to 1 hour/6 hour/12 hour/1 day/1 week. Support periodic silence function, and you can choose "only once" and "repeat".
- Notification Objects: Each silent task can be configured with related notification objects, supporting the configuration of one or more notification objects for the generation and modification of silent rules. You can set [notification object]](notify-object.md) by mail, robot (enterprise WeChat, nail, flying book) and Webhook.
- Notification content: After setting the notification object, you need to customize the related notification content to ensure that the notified person can know the silence details, which can contain up to 256 characters.
- Notification time: After setting the notification object, you need to set the time to trigger the notification, which supports setting the action of triggering the notification immediately, 15 minutes before the start of silence, 30 minutes before the start of silence and 1 hour before the start of silence.
