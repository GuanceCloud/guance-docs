## FAQ
**1.How to configure the detection frequency of Alibaba Cloud asset check**

In DataFlux Func, setting automatic trigger time for detection function through "management/automatic trigger configuration" suggests that the check interval should not be too short, which will cause task accumulation, and it is recommended to configure it for half an hour.

**2.What do you think of the relevant measurement collected by Alibaba Cloud Asset Check**

You can refer to the measurement in the report data format in the Alibaba Cloud Integration document [(e.g., Alibaba Cloud ECS)](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-aliyun-ecs/) for data viewing.

**3. Abnormal errors are found in scripts that were previously running normally during the inspection process**

Please update the referenced script set in DataFlux Func's script marketplace, you can view the update log of the script marketplace via [**Change Log**](https://func.guance.com/doc/script-market-guance-changelog/) to facilitate immediate script update.
