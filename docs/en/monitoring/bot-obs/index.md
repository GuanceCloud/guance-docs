### New Inspection

* **Workspace Asset Intelligent Inspection**: For service inspections, it is essential to ensure the normal operation of the service, detect faults or abnormalities in a timely manner, and reduce business losses. Secondly, inspections help improve service availability and stability, identify and resolve potential problems. Inspections can also enhance operational efficiency, accelerate problem diagnosis and resolution, and optimize resource allocation. Ensuring business security is of utmost importance. By regularly inspecting services such as hosts, K8s, and containers, operations personnel can ensure that these services can efficiently and stably support the business, providing a continuously reliable operating environment for the enterprise.

### New Inspection

* **Cloud Idle Resources Intelligent Inspection**: Cloud computing, as a rapidly developing new IT service method, provides enterprises and individuals with convenient, fast, and flexible IT infrastructure and application services, bringing extremely high efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, as cloud resources gradually become a major part of enterprise data centers, the problem of massive waste of resources in the cloud becomes more significant. Especially within the enterprise scope, due to factors such as demand fluctuations and isolation between departments, some cloud resources cannot be fully utilized, resulting in a large amount of idle resources. This situation leads to a linear increase in the cost of enterprise cloud services, a decrease in resource efficiency, and a potential reduction in security and performance levels. In order to better manage and optimize idle resources in the cloud, and to improve the usage benefits and resource utilization of cloud computing, it is essential to inspect idle resources in the cloud. Through inspection, unnecessary resources in the current cloud services can be discovered and processed promptly, avoiding problems such as cost overhead, data leakage, and poor performance due to long-term unnecessary resource usage.
* **Host Restart Intelligent Inspection**: Host abnormal restart monitoring is an important aspect of modern internet system operation and maintenance. On the one hand, the stability and reliability of computer systems are crucial for the smooth operation of businesses and the user experience. When a host experiences abnormal restarts or other issues, it may lead to system crashes, service interruptions, and data loss, which in turn affect business operations and user satisfaction. On the other hand, with the increasing number and scale of hosts in cloud computing and virtualization environments, system complexity is also constantly increasing, as is the probability of problems occurring. This requires system administrators to use relevant system monitoring tools for real-time monitoring and promptly discover and resolve abnormal restarts and other issues. Therefore, implementing host abnormal restart monitoring in a reasonable manner can help enterprises quickly diagnose problems, reduce business risks, improve operation and maintenance efficiency, and enhance user experience.

## March 23, 2023

### New Inspections

* **Idle Resources Intelligent Inspection**: As the business grows, the amount of resource usage also increases, making enterprise data centers larger and larger, and the problem of waste from idle servers becomes more significant. Especially within the enterprise scope, due to factors such as demand fluctuations and isolation between departments, some servers cannot be fully utilized, resulting in a large amount of idle resources. This situation leads to a linear increase in the cost of enterprise cloud services, a decrease in resource efficiency, and a potential reduction in security and performance levels.

## February 9, 2023

### New Inspections

* **RUM Performance Intelligent Integration**: Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an application performance monitoring technology designed to evaluate website performance by simulating the behavior of real users browsing the site. The goal of RUM is to understand website performance from the user's perspective, including website load times, page rendering effects, page element loading status, and interaction response. The main use case of RUM performance inspection is for client-side websites, such as e-commerce websites, financial websites, entertainment websites, and so on, which all need to provide users with a fast and smooth browsing experience. By analyzing the results of RUM performance, developers can quickly understand the user's actual experience and improve website performance.
* **Kubernetes Health Intelligent Integration**: Nowadays, Kubernetes has taken over the entire container ecosystem and acts as the brain for distributed container deployment, aiming to manage service-oriented applications using containers distributed across clusters of hosts. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for application deployment, scheduling, updates, service discovery, and scaling. However, how to ensure the health of Kubernetes nodes? Through smart inspections, information retrieval and problem discovery based on the current node's resource status, application performance management, service failure logs, etc. can be used to speed up event investigation, reduce engineers' pressure, decrease average repair time, and improve the end-user experience.

### New inspection

* **Cloud Account Billing Inspection Intelligent Integration**：Cloud (now only suport alibaba cloud) Account Billing Inspection helps subscribers manage budget alerts, abnormal cost alerts, forecast costs for cloud services and provides subscribers with the ability to visualize and support multi-dimensional visualization of consumption of cloud service resources.

* **Alibaba Cloud Preemptible Instance Survival Intelligent Inspection**：Since the market price of the preemptible instances fluctuates with the change of supply and demand, it is necessary to specify the bid mode when creating the preemptible instance, and only when the real-time market price of the specified instance specification is lower than the bid price and the inventory is sufficient can the preemptible instance be successfully created. Therefore, it is particularly important to inspect the preemptible instance of cloud assets. When the preemptible instance is found to be about to be released through inspection, the latest price of all available zones of the current specification of the preemptible instance and the historical price of the changed preemptible instance will be indicated and appropriate treatment advice will be given.
