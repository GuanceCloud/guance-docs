# Best Practices for Deploying DataKit in Rancher

---

> _Author: Liu Yu Jie_

## Introduction

Rancher is an open-source enterprise-grade platform for managing Kubernetes clusters. To simplify the deployment of DataKit within Kubernetes clusters, DataKit supports deployment through the Rancher platform's app market. Additionally, DataKit provides the functionality to manage collector configuration files using a Git repository.

Deploying DataKit via Rancher and combining it with Git-managed collector configurations represents one of the best deployment methods for DataKit in Kubernetes clusters. By deploying DataKit as a DaemonSet, the Container collector is enabled by default. For more flexible configuration of the Container collector, this article adopts a custom approach to enabling the Container collector â€” that is, managing the `container.conf` file via a Git repository. Then, DataKit is deployed through Rancher's app market, and finally, the collected metrics are checked to verify whether the collector configuration in the Git repository has taken effect.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/) 1.18+
- Install [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/), and have permission to operate on Kubernetes clusters
- Install [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- Install [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) 3.0+

## Procedure

???+ warning

    The version information used in this example is as follows: DataKit `1.4.5`, Kubernetes `1.22.6`, Rancher `2.6.3`, Gitlab `14.9.4`

### Step 1: Create the dk-config Repository

Log in to "Gitlab" and click "Create blank project"

![image](../images/rancher-install-1.png)

Enter `datakit-conf` as the Project name and click "Create Project".

![image](../images/rancher-install-2.png)

Navigate into the dk-config project, create a new `container.conf` file with the following content. The container enables metric collection and disables stdout log collection for all images.

??? quote "`container.conf`"

    ```toml
    [inputs.container]
      docker_endpoint = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
      containerd_address = "/var/run/containerd/containerd.sock"

      enable_container_metric = true
      enable_k8s_metric = true
      enable_pod_metric = true

      ## Containers logs to include and exclude, default collect all containers. Globs accepted.
      container_include_log = []
      container_exclude_log = ["image:*"]

      exclude_pause_container = true

      ## Removes ANSI escape codes from text strings
      logging_remove_ansi_escape_codes = false

      kubernetes_url = "https://kubernetes.default:443"

      ## Authorization level:
      ##   bearer_token -> bearer_token_string -> TLS
      ## Use bearer token for authorization. ('bearer_token' takes priority)
      ## linux at:   /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
      ## windows at: C:\var\run\secrets\kubernetes.io\serviceaccount\token
      bearer_token = "/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token"
      # bearer_token_string = "<your-token-string>"

      [inputs.container.tags]
        # some_tag = "some_value"
        # more_tag = "some_other_value"

    ```

Then click "Clone" - "Clone with HTTP", obtaining the git address [http://120.26.37.252/root/dk-config.git](http://120.26.37.252/root/dk-config.git).

### Step 2: Create Namespace

For ease of management, install DataKit into the datakit namespace.<br/>
Log in to "Rancher" - "Clusters" - "Projects/Namespace", and click "Create Namespace".

![image](../images/rancher-install-4.png)

Enter "datakit" as the name and click "Create".

![image](../images/rancher-install-5.png)

### Step 3: Add Chart Repository

Log in to "Rancher" - "Clusters" - "App Market" - "Chart Repositories", and click "Create". Enter **datakit** as the name, input [https://pubrepo.<<< custom_key.brand_main_domain >>>/chartrepo/datakit](https://pubrepo.<<< custom_key.brand_main_domain >>>/chartrepo/datakit) as the URL, and click "Create".

![image](../images/rancher-install-6.png)

### Step 4: Deploy DataKit

Log in to "Rancher" - "Clusters" - "App Market" - "Charts", select "datakit", and you will see the icon labeled **DataKit**, then click to enter.

![image](../images/rancher-install-7.png)

Click "Install".

![image](../images/rancher-install-8.png)

Select the "datakit" namespace and click "Next".

![image](../images/rancher-install-9.png)

Click "Datakit Configuration" and replace `<your-token>` with <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s token. Since we are using a custom container collector configuration, remove `container` from "Enable the default Inputs".

Click "Git Management Configurations" to set up the Git repository information, as shown below.

- Check "Enable Use Git Management Configurations"
- Fill in the Git Hub Url with the git address of dk-config [http://120.26.37.252/root/dk-config.git](http://120.26.37.252/root/dk-config.git), and append the Git username root and password xxxxxx after `http://`.
- Fill in the branch `main` for "The Git Branch".

Then click "Install".

> **Note:** If you check "Enable git SSH key," the configuration will be pulled from the Git repository via SSH.

Click "Kube-State-Metrics" and check "Deployment KubeState Metrics Deployment" to install the `kube-state-metrics` component; if not needed, leave it unchecked.

![image](../images/rancher-install-12.png)

Click "metrics-server" and check "Deployment kubeState Metrics Server Deployment" to install the `metrics-server` component; if not needed, leave it unchecked.

Finally, click "Install".

### Step 5: Resource Quotas

To limit the CPU and memory usage of DataKit, you can restrict DataKit's resource usage through Rancher.

Navigate to "Clusters" - "Workloads" - "DaemonSets", click on the right side of the datakit row, select "Edit Configuration", then click "Resource Limits and Reservations". Allocate resources reasonably based on your server's capacity, then click "Save".

### Step 6: Verify Metric Collection

Log in to "Rancher", click the command-line icon in the top-right corner, and execute the following commands to enter datakit.<br/>
If the `container.conf` file exists under the gitrepos directory, it indicates that the Git repository configuration was successfully fetched.

```shell
 kubectl get pods -n datakit
 kubectl exec -it datakit-qc58m -n datakit bash
 cd gitrepos/
 ls
```

![image](../images/rancher-install-15.png)

Log in to "[<<< custom_key.brand_name >>>](https://<<< custom_key.studio_main_site >>>/)" - "Metrics", select the "kubernetes" Measurement, and check that the metrics contain data, indicating that metric collection is functioning properly.

### Step 7: Upgrade

When there is a version upgrade for DataKit, the Rancher UI will display the available upgrade version.

Navigate to Rancher "Clusters" - "App Market" - "Installed Apps", in the "Upgrade" column of the datakit row, there is a pending upgrade version `1.4.6`. Click to enter the upgrade interface.

![image](../images/rancher-install-17.png)

Select version `1.4.6` and click "Next".

![image](../images/rancher-install-18.png)

Click "Upgrade".

![image](../images/rancher-install-19.png)

After the upgrade is complete, you will see that the DataKit version is now `1.4.6`.
