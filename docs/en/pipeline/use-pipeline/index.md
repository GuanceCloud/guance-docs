# Pipeline Manual

Starting from DataKit v1.4.0, the built-in data processor function of Pipeline can be used to modify, extract, filter, aggregate, and more, on the data collected or received by DataKit, supporting all current data categories (such as Logging, Metric, Tracing, Network, and Resource Catalog etc.).

The programmable data processor of DataKit Pipeline supports the runtime provided by the domain-specific language Platypus, developed and customized for Guance. More programming languages and runtimes will be added to Pipeline in the future.
