# Upgrade Commercial Version
---

Guance Cloud Community Version provides a simple, easy-to-get and fully functional local deployment platform for community users such as teachers, students and cloud computing enthusiasts. You can apply for free, download and try it out, build your own Guance Cloud platform, and experience complete product functions. 
The Guance Community Version supports upgrading to the commercial version, which is divided into subscription plate making, license plate making and pay-as-you-go version. 

## Upgrade to Pay-as-you-go Version
After the Guance community version is upgraded to the commercial pay-as-you-go version, it would be charged according to the number of DK installations. DK (DataKit) is a real-time data collector for Guance, which needs to be deployed to users' own IT environment for data collection. A DK is 5 yuan/day. If the DK of reported data is less than 20, the fee would be charged according to 20 DKs.
