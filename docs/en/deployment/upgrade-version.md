# Upgrade to Commercial Plan
---

The <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Free Plan provides a simple, accessible, and fully functional productized local deployment platform for community users such as teachers, students, and cloud computing enthusiasts. You can apply for it free of charge, download it for trial use, and build your own <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> platform to experience the complete set of product features.

The <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Free Plan supports upgrading to the Commercial Plan. The Commercial Plan is divided into subscription-based, license-based, and pay-as-you-go versions.

## Upgrade to Pay-As-You-Go Version

After upgrading from the <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Free Plan to the commercial pay-as-you-go version, charges will be based on the number of DK installations. DK (DataKit) is <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>'s real-time data collector, which must be deployed in the user's own IT environment to collect data. The cost is $0.7 per DK per day. If the number of DKs reporting data is less than 20, it will be charged as if there were 20 DKs.

### Select Upgrade Version


In the [<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Billing Center](https://<<< custom_key.boss_domain >>>/#/signin), click "Upgrade to Commercial Plan." In "Plan Upgrade," select "Commercial Plan - Pay-As-You-Go Version" and click "Upgrade Now."

**Note**:

1. If the License is not activated, you will temporarily be unable to query data.

2. Keep the data gateway address suffix **`**?token={}**`** exactly as it is; do not remove it. Do not fill in an actual token, as **`**{}**`** is just a placeholder.
