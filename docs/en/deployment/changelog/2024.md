### Deployment Edition Update {#deployment1225}

#### Launcher Update

1. Kubernetes Operation History Record

    - All changes to Kubernetes now support version history records for easier tracking and management.

2. Added Workload Management Functionality

    - Supports adjusting the number of Workload replicas.
    - Supports modifying the Workload image address.
    - Supports configuring Workload resource limits (Limit), taints (Taint), affinity (Affinity), and other settings.
    - Supports rolling back Workload to historical versions with a single click, as well as comparing differences between versions.

3. Launcher Service Management

    - Added functionality to directly close the Launcher service from the Launcher interface.

4. Registry Key Configuration Synchronization

    - After modifying the Registry Key configuration, it will automatically synchronize and update the `registry-key` Secret pre-configured in Kubernetes services.

5. Enhanced Deployment Security

    - During new deployments, the password for the backend administrator account must be manually entered during the installation information collection phase to ensure security.

6. UI Optimization

    - Added an Icon identifier to all feature menus to enhance visual effects and improve user experience.

#### Feature Updates

1. The deployment edition supports [custom navigation bar and operation button display text](../../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Backend member menu optimization:

    - Added a "Login Type" column, supporting differentiation between default login members and SSO login members, and allowing filtering by login type;
    - For SSO login members, supports editing the "Other Attributes" field, enabling customization of attribute information. This information is synchronized to Webhook externally and corresponding event content areas when sending alerts.

3. Main storage engine for Volcengine workspaces: storage policies for traces, logs, and custom log indices have been adjusted to Standard Storage, Infrequent Storage, and Archive Storage, which can be separately configured for hot data, infrequent data, and archive data storage durations. Simultaneously, if the main storage engine is Volcengine, when adding a new index in <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Console, the storage policy synchronously adjusts to Standard Storage, Infrequent Storage, and Archive Storage.

### OpenAPI Update {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports retrieving a list of resource catalogs, and supports [creating](../../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modifying](../../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[deleting](../../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[exporting](../../open-api/objc-set/export.md) resource viewers.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metrics, and supports [creating](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modifying](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enabling/disabling](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[deleting](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) metrics.

### Feature Update {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automatic writing of [Pipeline](../../pipeline/index.md): Traditional log parsing methods often rely on manual script writing based on familiarity with rules, consuming significant time and prone to errors, reducing the efficiency of writing Pipelines and making it difficult to respond to and resolve issues promptly. To improve efficiency and reduce manual costs, this feature leverages large models' natural language processing capabilities to assist in automating log content parsing, helping developers write Pipelines more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large amounts of logs, simplifying data flow and processing.

#### Monitoring

AI Alert Compression Merge: Through large models compressing monitoring alert events, reduces alert redundancy, especially when the system generates a large number of alerts within a short period. By consolidating alert events, ensures that operations personnel receive only one comprehensive alert message within a specified time cycle (e.g., 10 minutes), rather than multiple repetitive alert messages.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

Added currency category display to cloud billing scenario views and viewers.

#### Scenario

1. Dashboards, built-in views added [ID markers](../../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely determined through ID markers. When configuring jump links in charts, dashboards or user views can be located via ID markers.
2. Viewer [auto-refresh](../../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#refresh) logic adjustment: Removed the "pause" button in the time component, added "off" option in refresh frequency options so users can disable auto-refresh as needed, making operations simpler and more intuitive. At the same time, removed the "viewer auto-refresh" switch in personal settings to avoid redundant features and optimize user settings experience.
3. New functions added to viewer: `MD5()`, supporting querying desensitized log data encrypted with MD5 in the viewer.
4. Chart Optimization: Charts support obtaining PromQL metric names for legends, using `{__name__}` to configure metric name aliases for display.
5. PromQL editor added syntax highlighting and syntax prompts.

#### Metrics

[Generate Metrics](../../metrics/generate-metrics.md) Optimization:

1. Consolidated all types of generated metrics under the metric directory for convenient unified viewing and management by users.
2. Supports performing re-aggregation operations on existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing more dimensions for data analysis.

#### Management

Optimization of data access and sensitive data viewing desensitization rule application: Optimized multi-rule multi-role combination overlay data viewing scope. If a member has multiple roles, the final data access scope takes the union of defined ranges in the rules, and the desensitization rules for sensitive data viewing follow the same principle.

#### Infrastructure

Resource Catalog [Cross-workspace Query](../../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace): In the resource catalog menu, implemented support for cross-workspace querying of resource list data.

1. After modifying the Registry Key configuration in Launcher, the corresponding registry-key configuration in k8s will be updated in real-time.

### Feature Update {#feature1211}

#### Scene

1. [Topology Map](../../scene/visual-chart/topology-map.md) added external data query: Allows users to achieve external data topology drawing through DataFlux Func. Users only need to connect data according to the chart structure to easily realize the visualization of external data.
2. [Chart](../../scene/visual-chart/index.md#type) Optimization
    - Chart Display Effect Optimization: Optimized the display effect of charts, adjusted to slide-out listings, categorized displays, making chart finding and use more convenient.
    - Chart Description and Use Case Display: Added chart description and use case display in the chart list, which can help users better understand and select appropriate chart types.
3. View Variable Optimization
    - View variables support configuring upper limits for value listings, avoiding performance issues caused by excessive data listings.
    - Default listed upper limit for deployment edition is 50, supporting customizable default listed quantities. Note: Page configuration restrictions take precedence over global restrictions.

#### Infrastructure

    - Added grouping function: To improve resource management efficiency, added resource grouping functionality. Users can group similar resources for easier management and viewing, optimizing the organization of resources.
    - Explorer Cell Chart Mode Optimization: Supports configuring "color fill" and "group analysis" fields, allowing users to customize optional fields as needed.
2. Container, Resource Directory Explorer Search Optimization: Container explorer added `container_name` search, resource directory added `name` search.

#### Monitoring

Alert Policy Configuration Optimization

- Supports creating associated monitors via the alert policy entry [with one-click creation](../../monitoring/alert-setting.md#with_monitor), introducing a unified alert notification management model centered on alert policies.
- Optimized interaction for displaying related alert policy lists.

#### RUM

RUM added support for React Native application types and allows uploading SourceMap for data parsing and restoration. If you need to upload SourceMap for React Native applications originally created under Android / iOS types, note:

1. When creating a new application, choose the "React Native" application type. During creation, you can directly copy the name and application ID of existing React Native applications under Android / iOS types, then click the "Create" button. After creation, you can configure SourceMap under this application. This change only involves the creation method of React Native applications and does not affect data collection.

2. If your React Native application under Android / iOS types has associated monitors and you have not recreated a React Native application with the same ID under the "React Native" type, the original monitors can continue to work normally. However, if you have already recreated a "React Native" type application, the original monitor will fail to retrieve data under the "Application Name" item and display as blank. In such cases, you need to select the "React Native" application type and resave this monitor.

#### APM

APM Installation Guide Added [Auto Injection Method](../../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM (APM) installation guide, added a Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method. This method simplifies the APM deployment process, enabling users to quickly install and use APM in a Kubernetes environment.

This adjustment produces additional timelines, specifically the number of filtered detection dimensions (service, source) * detection metric quantity, since there is no storage of monitor filter conditions. If monitor filter conditions are modified, new equivalent timelines will be generated on the same day, resulting in repeated timeline billing on the modification day, returning to normal the next day after modification.
