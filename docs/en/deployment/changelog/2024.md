### Deployment Edition Updates {#deployment1225}

#### Launcher Updates

1. Kubernetes Operation History

    - All changes to Kubernetes now support version history for easy traceability and management.

2. New Workload Management Features

    - Supports adjusting the number of workload replicas.
    - Supports modifying the workload image address.
    - Supports configuring workload resource limits (Limit), taints (Taint), affinity (Affinity), etc.
    - Supports rolling back workloads to historical versions with one click, as well as comparing differences between versions.

3. Launcher Service Management

    - Added a feature in the Launcher interface to directly turn off the Launcher service.

4. Registry Key Configuration Synchronization

    - After modifying the Registry Key configuration, it will automatically synchronize updates to the `registry-key` Secret pre-configured in Kubernetes services.

5. Enhanced Deployment Security

    - During new deployments, the password for the backend administrator account must be manually entered during the installation information collection phase to ensure security.

6. UI Optimization

    - Added an Icon identifier to all function menus to enhance visual effects and improve user experience.

#### Function Updates

1. The deployment edition supports [custom navigation bar and operation button display text](../../deployment/customize-frontend-languge.md).

2. Backend Member Menu Optimization:

    - Added a "Login Type" column to distinguish default login members from SSO login members and support filtering by login type;
    - For SSO login members, editing of "Other Attributes" fields is supported, allowing customization of attribute information. This information is synchronized to Webhook notifications and corresponding event content areas when sending alerts.

3. For workspaces using Volcengine as the main storage engine, the storage strategy for traces, logs, and custom log indices has been adjusted to Standard Storage, Low-Frequency Storage, and Archive Storage, which can be configured separately for hot data, low-frequency data, and archive data storage durations. Simultaneously, if the main storage engine is Volcengine, when adding new indices in <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Console, the storage strategy is also synchronized to Standard Storage, Low-Frequency Storage, and Archive Storage.

### OpenAPI Updates {#openapi1225}

1. Resource Catalog: Supports retrieving resource catalog lists, and supports [creating](../../open-api/objc-set/create.md)/[modifying](../../open-api/objc-set/modify.md)/[deleting](../../open-api/objc-set/delete.md)/[exporting](../../open-api/objc-set/export.md) resource viewers.
2. Generated Metrics: Supports listing metric lists and supports [creating](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/add.md)/[modifying](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/modify.md)/[enabling/disabling](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/set-disable.md)/[deleting](../../open-api/aggs-to-metric/delete.md) metrics.

### Function Updates {#feature1225}

#### Pipeline

Automatic writing of [Pipeline](../../pipeline/index.md): Traditional log parsing methods often rely on manual scripting based on rule familiarity, consuming significant time and prone to errors, leading to low efficiency in writing Pipelines and inability to promptly respond to issues. To improve efficiency and reduce manual costs, this feature leverages natural language processing capabilities of large models to assist in automating log content parsing, helping developers write Pipelines more efficiently and accurately extract valuable information from large volumes of logs, simplifying data flow and processing.

#### Monitoring

AI Alert Compression and Merging: Alerts are compressed and merged through large models to reduce redundancy, especially when the system generates a large number of alerts in a short period. By consolidating alert events, it ensures that operators receive only one comprehensive alert within a specified time cycle (e.g., 10 minutes) instead of multiple repetitive alerts.

#### Cloud Billing Analysis

Cloud billing scenario views and viewers add displays for consumption currency categories.

#### Scenarios

1. Dashboards, built-in views added [ID labels](../../scene/dashboard/index.md#id): Dashboards and user views can be uniquely determined via ID labels, enabling linking configurations in charts to locate dashboards or user views.
2. Viewer [auto-refresh](../../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#refresh) logic adjustment: Removed the "pause" button in the time component, added "off" option in refresh frequency options, allowing users to disable auto-refresh as needed for simpler and more intuitive operations. Simultaneously, removed the "viewer auto-refresh" switch in personal settings to avoid redundant functionality and optimize user settings experience.
3. Viewer added function: `MD5()`, supporting querying desensitized logs encrypted by MD5 in the viewer.
4. Chart Optimization: Charts support obtaining PromQL metric names as legends, allowing `{__name__}` configuration for metric name aliases.
5. PromQL editor added syntax highlighting and suggestion features.

#### Metrics

[Generated Metrics](../../metrics/generate-metrics.md) optimization:

1. Consolidated all types of generated metrics under the metric directory for easier unified viewing and management by users.
2. Supported re-aggregation operations on existing metric data to generate new metrics, providing more analytical dimensions.

#### Management

Data access and sensitive data viewing desensitization rule application optimization: Optimized multi-rule and multi-role combined data viewing scope. If a member has multiple roles, the final data access scope takes the union of defined scopes within the rules, and the same applies to sensitive data viewing desensitization rules.

#### Infrastructure

Resource Catalog [cross-workspace queries](../../infrastructure/custom/index.md#cross_workspace): In the resource catalog menu, implemented support for cross-workspace resource list data queries.

1. After modifying the Registry Key configuration in Launcher, the corresponding registry-key configuration in k8s will be updated in real-time.

### Function Updates {#feature1211}

#### Scenarios

1. [Topology Map](../../scene/visual-chart/topology-map.md) added external data queries: Allows users to draw topology maps using external data via DataFlux Func. Users need only connect data according to the chart structure to easily achieve visualization of external data.
2. [Charts](../../scene/visual-chart/index.md#type) Optimization
    - Chart Display Effect Optimization: Improved the display effect of charts, changed to side-sliding listings, categorized displays, making chart searching and use more convenient.
    - Chart Descriptions and Use Cases Display: Added descriptions and applicable use cases in the chart list, helping users better understand and select appropriate chart types.
3. View Variable Optimization
    - View variables support setting value listing upper limits to avoid performance issues caused by excessive data listings.
    - Deployment Edition default listing upper limit is 50, supports customizing default listing quantities. Note: Page configuration restrictions take precedence over global restrictions.

#### Infrastructure

1. Resource Catalog Optimization:
    - Added Grouping Function: To improve resource management efficiency, added a resource grouping function. Users can group similar resources for easier management and viewing, optimizing the organization of resources.
    - Explorer Honeycomb Mode Optimization: Supports configuring "Color Filling" and "Group Analysis" field lists, allowing users to customize optional fields as needed.
2. Container and Resource Catalog Explorer Search Optimization: Added `container_name` search for container explorers, and `name` search for resource catalogs.

#### Monitoring

Alert Strategy Configuration Optimization

- Supports creating associated monitors via the alert strategy entry [with one click](../../monitoring/alert-setting.md#with_monitor), adding a unified alert notification management mode centered around alert strategies.
- Optimized interactive display of associated alerts in the alert strategy list.

#### RUM

RUM added support for React Native application types and allows uploading SourceMap for data parsing and restoration. If you need to upload SourceMap for a React Native application originally created under Android / iOS types, note:

1. When creating a new application, select the "React Native" application type. During creation, you can directly copy the name and application ID of an existing React Native application under Android / iOS types, then click the "Create" button. After completion, you can configure SourceMap under this application. This change only involves the creation method of React Native applications and does not affect data collection.

2. If your original React Native application under Android / iOS types has associated monitors and you have not yet recreated the same ID React Native application under the "React Native" type, the original monitor can continue to work normally. However, if you have already recreated the "React Native" type application, the original monitor will fail to retrieve data in the "Application Name" item, showing blank. In such cases, you need to select the "React Native" application type and save the monitor again.

#### APM

APM Installation Guide added [automatic injection method](../../application-performance-monitoring/explorer/auto_wire/apm_datakit_operator.md): In the APM (Application Performance Monitoring) installation guide, a Kubernetes Operator automatic injection installation method was added. This method simplifies the APM deployment process, enabling users to install and use APM more quickly in a Kubernetes environment.

### <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> Update

- Monitoring:
    - Smart Monitoring:
        - Host, log, application intelligent detection frequency adjusted to execute every 10 minutes, each execution calculating as 10 calls for fees;
        - To enhance algorithm accuracy, logs and application intelligent detection adopt data retention methods. Initiating a smart monitor generates corresponding metric sets and metric data. This adjustment produces additional timelines, specifically the number of detection dimensions (service, source) * detection metric numbers filtered by the current monitor configuration. Since there is no storage of monitor filter conditions, modifying monitor filter configurations on the same day generates new equivalent timelines, leading to duplicate timeline billing on the day of modification, returning to normal the next day.
    - Alert Strategy Management:
        - Added custom notification time configuration, refining alert notification configurations by cycle and time intervals;
        - Repeated alerts added 【Permanent】as an event option.

        - Incident Tracking Issue Transformation: Added 【Event Recovery Sync Close Issue】switch, synchronously recovering incident tracking Issues when abnormal events recover;
        - Added clone buttons to the monitor list.
        - Notification Object Management: Added simple HTTP notification type, directly receiving alert notifications via Webhook address;
- Scenarios:
    - Charts: Added 【Currency】option for units; Advanced Configuration > Year-on-Year Comparison changed to 【Year-on-Year/Month-on-Month】;
    - Service Management > Resource Calls: Rankings added TOP/Bottom quantity selection.
