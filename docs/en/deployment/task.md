3. The node code will be automatically filled in;
4. Enter the Chinese name for the node;
5. Enter the English name for the node;
6. Click confirm.

**Note**: <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> will determine the language of the node names based on the workspace language and write them into the database accordingly.

## Manage Node List

1. You can search for nodes by entering the Chinese or English node name in the search bar;
2. Hover over the Chinese or English node name to directly edit it in the list;
3. Click "Get Configuration" to copy the configuration information directly from the pop-up window;
4. Click "Delete" to remove the current node. After deletion, this node will no longer report data in associated Test tasks, but already reported data remains unaffected.
