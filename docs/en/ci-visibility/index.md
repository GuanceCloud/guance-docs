# CI Visualization
---

Guance supports visualization of the process and results of CI built into Gitlab/Jenkins. You can view the results of your CI in Gitlab/Jenkins directly through the CI visualization feature of Guance.The CI process is continuous integration. If developers encounter problems when pushing code, they can view the success rate, failure reasons, and specific failure links of all CI processes in Guance to help you provide code update assurance.

## Glossary

- CI/CD：It stands for Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), Continuous Deployment (CD)，It is an approach to frequent delivery of applications to customers by introducing automation in the application development phase, mainly to address the issues raised when integrating new code；
- Continuous integration: allows developers to more easily integrate code into master branches during code development and automatically build applications for automated testing to validate updated code, with the main goal of catching integration errors early and bringing teams closer together for better collaboration；
- Continuous Delivery: A code base that can be readily deployed to production environments on top of continuous integration；
- Continuous deployment: Automated release of applications to production environments based on continuous delivery；
- Pipeline：A pipeline of CI/CD processes, from integration testing to delivery and deployment, throughout the application lifecycle；
- Job：Pipeline All tasks in the entire process；
- Gitlab：Ruby on Rails-based open source project that uses Git as a code management tool, accessible through a web interface, to support the development, deployment, and maintenance of code；
- Jenkins：Java-based development of open source projects for continuous integration tools that support automated code build, test, integration deployment .

## Main Functions

- CI process visualization: visualize all CI processes from pipeline and job；
- Statistical analysis of CI results: statistics of success rate and failure rate of all CIs from pipeline and job
