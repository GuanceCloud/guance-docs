# Data Collection
---

## Introduction

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> supports reporting the process and results of Gitlab/Jenkins built-in CI to <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> for visualization. You can install DataKit, enable the Gitlab/Jenkins collector, and report the results generated by the entire CI process (such as Build, Test, Deploy) to DataKit. After processing through the DataWay data gateway, the data is reported to <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> for viewing and analysis.

## Prerequisites

You need to create a [<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> account](https://auth.guance.com/register?channel=Help Documentation) and [install DataKit](../datakit/datakit-install.md) on your host.

## Data Collection

After installing DataKit, you can enable the [Gitlab](../integrations/gitlab.md) / [Jenkins](../integrations/jenkins.md) collector in the DataKit installation directory. After restarting DataKit, you can obtain CI-related data.
