# High Performance Mode
---


Guance supports chart high-performance loading mode, which is closed by default. You can click on the account in the lower left corner and select **High-performance Mode** to open it.

## Example Effect

After the high-performance mode is turned on, all charts are not dynamically loaded, but directly loaded when clicking to enter the page, that is, all charts have been loaded when sliding down beyond the current page, and the display results can be directly viewed.

Note: When high performance mode is turned on, view the chart only for the current user.
