# Cloud Account Management

During the operation of an enterprise, it often needs to use multiple cloud service accounts to meet different business requirements. However, when these cloud services fail, a decentralized management approach may lead to inefficiency and increase the operational costs for the enterprise.

The <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> cloud account management feature consolidates all of the enterpriseâ€™s cloud service accounts for unified management, distinguishing them by the uniqueness of certain configurations under each account. By configuring integrated collectors, each cloud service under an account is managed independently, thereby achieving fine-grained control over business data.

This management method not only simplifies the enterprise's cloud service management process but also helps quickly locate and resolve service failures, significantly reducing management costs and improving fault response speed.

**Note**: This feature currently supports configuration only by **workspace owners and managers**.

## Configure Integration

When a cloud account is successfully created, it means that the account has been authorized to <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>. Next, you can install integrations as needed under this cloud account and start collecting data.

**Note**: Different integrations require authorization for different resources. Please grant the appropriate permissions to the cloud account according to the integration documentation. Otherwise, there may be cases where the integration installation succeeds, but data collection fails.

**Prerequisite**: The [DataFlux Func (Automata)](../dataflux-func/automata.md) must be activated.


### Configuration in Cloud Account Information

Click into the cloud account information details page > Integrations, where you can view all related integrations under the current account.
