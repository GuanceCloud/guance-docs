# MFA Management
---

Guance provides MFA authentication management, which helps to add an additional layer of security protection to the account user name and password. After MFA authentication is turned on, you need to perform secondary verification when logging in to help you improve the security of your account.

## Preconditions

When using Guance MFA authentication, you need to download and install Google Authenticator on your mobile phone to obtain MFA security code.


## Bind MFA

In the Guance workspace, click **Your Account > Account Management** in the lower left corner, MFA Authentication under **Security Settings**, and click **Bind** on the right.

Binding MFA authentication supports verification by email. Click and get verification code input, and then click OK.

If you have not downloaded and installed Google Authenticator on your mobile phone before, you can download and install it first. After the installation is completed, use Google Authenticator to scan and obtain MFA security code.

Fill in the obtained 6-digit dynamic security code on the above page and click OK. You can modify or delete the added account with the button ... in the upper right corner.

After clicking OK, prompt MFA binding successfully, return to **Account Management** page, and prompt **Bound** in MFA Authentication.

## Log in to MFA Authenticated Account

## Unbind MFA

### Method 1

If you no longer need to use MFA authentication, you can unbind MFA for your account. In Guance workspace, click **Account > Account Management** in the lower left corner, **MFA Authentication** under **Security Settings**, click Unbind on the right, enter the dynamic code, and click OK.

After unbinding, you can see that the **MFA Authentication** prompt is unbound.

At the same time, you will receive an unbound email reminder from Guance.

### Method 2

If the device installed with MFA authentication is not around when logging in, and the security code cannot be generated for logging in, you can contact Guance customer service to apply for unbinding. On the login page, click **Unbind MFA**, select the work order type as **Unbind MFA**, fill in the work order title, description and email verification code, and submit the work order.

After receiving the application, Guance customer service will handle it for you as soon as possible. See [work order management](work-order-management.md).
