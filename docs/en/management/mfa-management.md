# MFA Management
---

## Overview
MFA, namely **Multi-Factor Authentication**, helps to add an additional layer of security protection to the account user name and password. After MFA in Guance is turned on, you need to perform secondary verification when logging in to help you improve the security of your account.

## Preconditions

When using Guance MFA, you need to download and install **Google Authenticator** on your mobile phone to obtain MFA security code.


## Bind MFA

In the Guance workspace, click **Your Account > Account Management** in the lower left corner, MFA under **Security Settings**, and click **Bind** on the right.

Binding MFA supports verification by email. Click and get verification code input, and then click **Confirm**.

If you have not downloaded and installed Google Authenticator on your mobile phone before, you can download and install it first. After the installation is completed, use Google Authenticator to scan and obtain MFA security code.

## Unbind MFA

### Method 1

If you no longer need to use MFA, you can unbind MFA for your account. In Guance workspace, click **Account > Account Management** in the lower left corner, **MFA** under **Security Settings**, click **Unbind** on the right, enter the dynamic code and click **Confirm**.

After unbinding, you can see that the **MFA** prompt is unbound.

At the same time, you will receive an unbound email reminder from Guance.

### Method 2

If the device installed with MFA is not around when logging in, and the security code cannot be generated for logging in, you can contact Guance customer service to apply for unbinding. On the login page, click **Unbind MFA**, select the ticket type as **Unbind MFA**, fill in the ticket title, description and email verification code and submit the ticket.

After receiving the application, Guance customer service will handle it for you as soon as possible. See [Ticket Management](work-order-management.md).
