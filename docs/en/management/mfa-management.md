# MFA Management
---

Guance provides MFA authentication management, which helps to add an additional layer of security protection to the account user name and password. After MFA authentication is turned on, you need to perform secondary verification when logging in to help you improve the security of your account.

## Preconditions

When using Guance MFA authentication, you need to download and install Google Authenticator on your mobile phone to obtain MFA security code.


## Bind MFA

In the Guance workspace, click "Your Account"-"Account Management" in the lower left corner, "MFA Authentication" under "Security Settings", and click "Bind" on the right.

If you have not downloaded and installed Google Authenticator on your mobile phone before, you can download and install it first. After the installation is completed, use Google Authenticator to scan and obtain MFA security code.
