## Notification Type

Guance currently provides three types of notification, including **quota warning notification, free quota exhaustion notification and Token change notification**. You will be notified by the system when the following conditions are met:

### Quota Warning Notification

In the workspace of the experience plan of Guance, when the billing usage of some functions is close to the maximum free quota (85%), you will receive a quota warning notification. <br /><br />For example, if the usage of DataKit Timeseries in the current space is 90%, which exceeds the upper limit of free quota by 85%, the quota warning notice will be triggered.<br />![](img/13_inform_02.png)<br />Note: To prevent duplicate messages, alert notification messages are sent only once a day.


### Free Quota Exhaustion Notification

In the workspace of the experience plan of Guance, when a certain billing usage of some functions has been used up, you will receive a notification that the free quota has been exhausted. <br /><br />For example, if the usage of **Task Scheduling Number** in the current space is 100% and one billing usage has been exhausted, the quota warning notification will be triggered. <br />![](img/13_inform_03.png)<br />Note: To prevent duplicate messages, free quota messages are sent only once a day.


### Token Change Notification

In the workspace of Guance, when the workspace administrator changes the Token of the current space, all members of the current space will receive the notification of Token invalidation, including the notification of Token invalidation and of Token delay invalidation.
