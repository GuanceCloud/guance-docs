# Function Menu Management

Guance supports manual setting of function menus, including hiding/displaying and adjusting menu order, which helps you customize the menu display of current workspace.

## Configure Custom Menus

In Guance workspace "Management"-"Settings"-"Advanced Settings"-"Function Menu Management", click "Configuration" to adjust the menu.
