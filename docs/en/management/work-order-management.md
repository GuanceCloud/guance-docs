# Ticket Management
---

If you encounter any issues while using <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, you can submit a ticket for consultation and suggestions. For example, if you face problems that are difficult to resolve during usage, have questions related to purchasing or billing, or wish to provide feedback or suggestions to <<< custom_key.brand_name >>>, the official team will promptly handle and respond to your tickets.

The ticket system is **workspace-based**, meaning submitted tickets will not be deleted due to the addition or removal of members. In the ticket list, you can view all tickets within the current workspace to understand past issues and feedback.

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> provides 5*8 hours of ticket service time. Customer service personnel will process your ticket as soon as possible after receiving it.

> For more details, see [Support Plans](https://<<< custom_key.brand_main_domain >>>/support).
