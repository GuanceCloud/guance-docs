# Tickets
---

To address any issues encountered in Guance, you can seek advice and guidance by submitting a ticket. This includes difficulties in resolving problems during usage, inquiries about purchases and costs, and suggestions for requirements and improvements to Guance. Once a ticket is received, the official team will promptly handle and provide feedback.

The ticket system is **based on the workspace level**, so submitted tickets will not disappear due to the addition or removal of a member. In the ticket list, you can view all the tickets within the current workspace and understand the problems encountered and the feedback given.

Guance provides 5x8 hours of ticket service. Once the customer support team receives a ticket, they will handle it as soon as possible.

Click on the **Help > Tickets** in the lower-left corner to access the ticket management portal:
