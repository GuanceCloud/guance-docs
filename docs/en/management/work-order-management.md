# Ticket Management
---

In view of the problems encountered in Guance, users can consult and make suggestions by submitting tickets, and the official will make timely processing and feedback. Issues include but are not limited to confusion in the process of using products, product functional requirements and consultation related to purchase and cost.

The ticket system is based on the personal account level, and you can view all the tickets in **Help > Ticket Management** submitted by yourself without distinguishing the workspace.

## Submit Tickets

On the **Ticket Management** page, you can directly click **Submit**, select the type of ticket and enter the title and description of the ticket to create it. Uploading attachments is supported.

> When the ticket type is **Change Owner Account**, you need to download the application form first, fill in the information as required, stamp the official seal of the company and upload the attachment. Please note: Incomplete application information will not be accepted.
