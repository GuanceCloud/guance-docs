After entering the war room, you can view the key metric trends of all workspaces to which the current account belongs. In the war room, you can view the trends of key metrics in the form of icons and lists, and you can sort and view the workspaces according to the dimensions of "Event Urgency", "Workspace" and "Number of Unrecovered Events".

- Event urgency: Sort by urgent > important > warning > no data
- Workspace: Sort by Alias > Workspace Name
- Number of unrecovered events: sorted according to the number of unrecovered events in the workspace for 48 hours

The following diagram shows the metric trend in the form of icons
