# Attribute Claims

<!--
Typically, a company creates multiple workspaces to manage different businesses. Therefore, when calling different services, the services monitored by the company may be scattered across various spaces. Attribute claims help you see the invocation relationships of all services from a global perspective and enable correlated queries using attribute fields.
-->

In **Manage > Attribute Claims**, you can view attribute information in JSON format. <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> predefines two fixed attribute fields: `organization` and `business`.

- `organization`: Automatically generated by the system; it is the organization ID, which is a unique ID generated based on the Billing Center account associated with the current workspace. All Commercial Plan workspaces belong to an organization. If multiple workspaces are bound to the same billing account, their IDs will be the same.
    
    - **Note**: For Deployment Plan users, the `organization` has a unified and fixed ID.

- `business`: Deletion is not supported; it has business attributes, allowing you to filter and view within the workspace list.

Click the edit button on the right to enter the attribute claim editing page:

As shown in the figure, `organization` cannot be edited or deleted; however, you can edit `business`.

Click **Add Attribute** to define custom attributes. Both the attribute name (`key`) and the attribute value (`value`) are required fields.

## Use Cases

When you configure custom fields in attribute claims, these fields will also be synchronized in scenarios where events are notified externally.
