# Feature Menu Management
---

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> supports manual configuration of feature menus, including hiding/displaying and adjusting the menu order, to help customize the menu display for the current workspace.

**Note**: Feature menu management is supported by users with administrator roles or above. After configuration is complete, subsequent workspace members will see the configured menu when they log in.

## Configure Custom Menus

**Note**: The menu configuration here will be affected by the [menu settings](../../deployment/menu.md) in the management backend, but it will not affect the menu configuration of the management backend.

In <<< custom_key.brand_name >>> workspace **Management > Settings > Advanced Settings > Feature Menu Management**, click **Configure** to adjust the menus.

In addition to the default selected states for Scenarios, Events, Monitoring, and Integrations, you can perform the following actions:

1. Check to display the feature menus for the current workspace;   
2. Adjust the menu order using the small icons on the right;  
3. Click **Reset** to revert to the [menus set](../../deployment/menu.md) uniformly by the management backend.
