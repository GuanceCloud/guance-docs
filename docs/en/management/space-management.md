## Window Operations

1. On this page, you can view all workspaces associated with your account.
2. On the workspace card, it directly displays your role permissions in that workspace, as well as the number of members in that workspace.
3. Filter by version, role, and business.
4. In the search bar, enter the workspace name or description to quickly search and locate.


## Card Operations

Hover over a workspace card to perform the following actions:

1. Click :octicons-clock-16: to view the creation time of the workspace.
2. Click :material-dots-vertical: to set notes for the current workspace; pin the space or set it as the default space (the workspace you enter by default after logging in, applicable only to the current login account); you can also exit or解散 the current workspace.

**Note**:

1. Only the owner of the workspace can解散 the current workspace. Once解散ed, data cannot be recovered, so please operate with caution.
2. After解散, the workspace will automatically be unlinked from the billing center and deleted.
