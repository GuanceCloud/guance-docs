# Sharing
---

Guance supports the unified management of charts and snapshots shared in the current space through **Management > Sharing**.


## Chart Sharing

Guance supports current space administrators and standard members to share and manage charts. Chart sharing can be used to insert charts into platform codes other than Guance for visual data presentation and analysis. 

> For details, see [Chart Sharing](../scene/visual-chart/chart-share.md).

After sharing the chart in **Scene > Inner View**, you can view the chart sharing list in the current space through **Management > Sharing > Chart Sharing**.

- **Cancel Sharing** will invalidate the shared chart and cannot be restored. **Please carefully confirm the cancelled sharing content**. You can also click on the :material-crop-square: next to the chart name to select specific charts to unshare in bulk.

- **Snapshot Name**: the name set when creating snapshots, and modification is not supported for the time being.

- [**Sharing Methods**](../getting-started/function-details/snapshot.md): include public sharing and encrypted sharing, and support sharing to anyone who has links or people who have shared links and keys.

- **Validity Period**: help you view the validity period of snapshot sharing. The default effective time of sharing links in Guance is 48 hours, that is, 48 hours after generating sharing links is the effective time.

- **Time Range**: help you understand the relative/absolute time range selected for snapshot saving. For example, the relative time range is the nearest 15 minutes.

- **View Snapshot**: help you view the corresponding snapshot. Click **View Snapshot** to jump to a new page to view the corresponding data copy

- **View Sharing Links**: help you adjust the sharing method (for example, add a password for public sharing), which will take effect after confirming the adjustment
