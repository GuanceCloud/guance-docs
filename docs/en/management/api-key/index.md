# API Key Management
---

Guance supports obtaining and updating the data of Guance workspace by calling Open API interface. Before calling API interface, it is necessary to create API Key as authentication method. For an introduction to the API, refer to the documentation [OpenAPI](../../management/api-key/open-api.md).


## Create API Key

In the Guance workspace "Management"-"API Key Management", click "New Key" in the upper right corner, enter the Key name, and click OK.

Note: API Key admin supports admin and above editable.
