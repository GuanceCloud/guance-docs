# API Key Management
---

Guance supports obtaining and updating the data of Guance workspace by calling Open API interface. Before calling API interface, it is necessary to create API Key as authentication method. For an introduction to the API, refer to the documentation [OpenAPI](../../management/api-key/open-api.md).


## Create API Key

In the Guance workspace **Management > API Key Management**, click **Create** in the upper right corner, enter the Key name, and click **Confirm**.

Note: Only Owner and Administrato can edit API Key.

Or you can get the API Key ID and key by clicking the view icon on the right side of the API Key management list. If it is no longer needed or there is a risk of leakage, it can be deleted and re-created.
