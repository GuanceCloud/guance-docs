# All Events
---

Enter **Events**, click :material-format-list-bulleted: to switch to **All Event Explorers** in the upper left corner, and you can view the list of all events in the current workspace.

Here, you can:

- Use stacked bar charts to count the number of events with different alert levels that occurred at different time points in the current event explorer.
- Search events based on tags, fields and text, and filter events based on keywords, tags, fields, and associations.
- Analyze aggregated events based on selected fields.


## Query and Analysis

- Time Widget: The All Event Explorers displays data from the last 15 minutes by default, and you can also customize the [time range](../../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#time) of the data display.

- Search and Filter: The search bar supports [multiple search and filter methods](../../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md).

- Analysis Mode: You can perform multidimensional analysis based on tag fields to reflect aggregated event statistics under different analysis dimensions. Clicking on an aggregated event allows you to view [aggregated event details](event-details.md).

- Quick Filter: You can edit [quick filters](../../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#quick-filter) through the quick filters on the left side of the list to add new filtering fields.

- Filter History: Guance supports saving the search condition history of the explorer `key:value` in the [filter history](../../getting-started/function-details/explorer-search.md#filter-history), which can be applied to different explorers in the current workspace.

- Create Monitor: You can directly jump to the [creating page](../../monitoring/monitor/index.md#new) through this link in the current explorer to quickly set up anomaly detection rules for events.

- Export: In the All Event Explorers, click Export to export the data of the current event explorer to CSV, dashboard and notes.

- Save Snapshot: In the upper left corner of the All Event Explorers, click View Snapshot History to directly save a snapshot of the current event. With the [snapshot](../../getting-started/function-details/snapshot.md), you can quickly reproduce the copied data and restore it to a certain point in time and a certain data display logic.
