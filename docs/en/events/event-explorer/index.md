# Explorer

By entering **Incidents > Explorer**, you can view and audit monitoring event information in one place, enabling real-time monitoring and unified querying of events triggered by sources such as monitors, Intelligent Inspection, and SLOs.

The Explorer mainly includes:

- [Unrecovered Events](./unrecovered-events.md): Displays all unrecovered events within the workspace;
- [Event List](./event-list.md): Provides a statistical list of all level events;
- [Event Details](./event-details.md): Displays detailed information about the event, including basic attributes, extended fields, historical records, and related events.
