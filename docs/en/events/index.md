# Events
---

## Overview

Guance Cloud supports one-stop viewing and auditing of all event data, and supports real-time monitoring, unified query, unrecovered event statistics and data export of events triggered by all sources. You can quickly locate exceptions and efficiently analyze exception data by aggregating related events and matching related events.

## Event Source

- All alarm events triggered based on the configured [Monitor](../monitor/monitor/index.md)
- All Alarm events triggered based on the configured [Auto Detection](../monitoring/bot-obs/index.md)
- All alarm events triggered based on configured [SLO](../monitoring/slo.md)
- Audit events based on system operations. For more details, refer to [Operational Audit](../management/operation-audit.md)
- Support for writing custom events through the OpenAPI of events. For more details, please refer to [Creating Event API](../open-api/keyevent/create.md)

## Usage Scenarios

- Unified event management
- Event visualization query and analysis
- Associated event query

## Function Introduction

- [Unrecovered event explorer](unrecovered-events.md)：Support to view all unrecovered events that have been continuously triggered in the workspace in the last 48 hours, including all events with abnormal current status (df_status! = ok). You can quickly view and solve fault problems based on the details of unrecovered events;
- [Event explorer](event-list.md)：Including all events triggered by all event sources, for example, each alarm record that triggers the "monitor" detection rule is an event data. You can query and analyze events by selecting time range, searching and filtering, grouping aggregation, etc.;
- [Export event JSON file](event-details.md)：Support exporting the JSON file of the current event in the event details page to obtain all the key data corresponding to the current event;
- [Monitor configuration trigger event](../monitoring/monitor/index.md)：Support to generate different events for management and analysis based on the trigger conditions of configuration monitors.

## Event Storage Policy

Guance Cloud provides three data storage time choices for event data: 14 days, 30 days and 60 days. If you choose the data storage time of 30 days, events generated from different sources will be stored in 30 days. You can adjust as required in "Administration"-"Basic Settings"-"Change Data Storage Policy". See the document [Data Storage Policy](../billing/billing-method/data-storage.md) for more data storage policies.
