# Events
---

Guance supports a one-stop view and audit of all event data. You can monitor and query events triggered by all sources in real-time, and also quickly identify anomalies and efficiently analyze abnormal data by aggregating related events and matching associated events.

## Where are events from?

- All alert events triggered based on the configured [Monitor](../monitor/monitor/index.md);
- Based on the configuration, all alert events triggered by [Intelligent Monitoring](../monitoring/intelligent-monitoring/index.md);  
- All alert events triggered based on the configured [Auto Detection](../monitoring/bot-obs/index.md);
- All alert events triggered based on configured [SLO](../monitoring/slo.md);
- [Audit](../management/operation-audit.md) events based on system operations;
- Support for writing custom events through the OpenAPI of events. For more details, see [Creating Event API](../open-api/keyevent/create.md).

## Use Cases

- Unified event management
- Event visualization query and analysis
- Associated event query

## Event Storage Policy

Guance provides three data storage time choices for event data: 14 days, 30 days and 60 days.
