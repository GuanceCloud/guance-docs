# Events

<<< custom_key.brand_name >>> provides a comprehensive event management and auditing platform that supports real-time monitoring and unified querying of multi-source event data. Through event aggregation and correlation, it can quickly locate anomalies and efficiently analyze data.

Under the **Events** feature module, you can monitor system abnormalities and service quality degradation issues through features such as monitors, intelligent inspections, and SLOs. **All monitoring activities will generate event records**, which are aggregated into the event analysis module for in-depth analysis and processing. This one-stop approach ensures that you have full visibility into the health of your system and can respond promptly to any potential issues.


## Event Sources

- Alert events triggered by meeting [Monitor](../monitoring/monitor/monitor-rule.md#content) and [Intelligent Monitoring](../monitoring/intelligent-monitoring/index.md) configuration rules;
- All alert events triggered based on configured [Intelligent Inspections](../monitoring/bot-obs/index.md) and [SLO](../monitoring/slo.md);
- [Audit Events](../management/operation-audit.md) generated by system operations;
- Custom events written via [OpenAPI](../open-api/keyevent/create.md).


## Viewing Event Records


- [Explorer > Unresolved Events Explorer](./event-explorer/unrecovered-events.md): Displays unresolved events within the last 48 hours for the current workspace (`df_status !=ok`);
- [Explorer > All Events Explorer](./event-explorer/event-list.md): Aggregates all events from various sources, including monitors, intelligent inspections, SLOs, audit events, and OpenAPI custom events;
- [Intelligent Monitoring](./inte-monitoring-event.md): Includes all events triggered by intelligent monitoring rules.


## Event Content

Taking events triggered by monitor rules as an example, the event content is primarily based on the information filled in at [Create Rules > Event Notifications](../monitoring/monitor/monitor-rule.md#notice).

As shown in the figure below, the event title is defined as `Log Detection - Multi Index`, and the event content includes DQL query statements and variables. The system generates and displays the final results based on actual monitoring data.

After the rule detects an anomaly, you can view related event content in Events > Event Details.
