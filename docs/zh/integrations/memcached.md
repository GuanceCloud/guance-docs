Memcached 采集器可以从 Memcached 实例中采集实例运行状态指标，并将指标采集到观测云，帮助监控分析 Memcached 各种异常情况。

## 配置 {#config}

### 前置条件 {#requirements}

- Memcached 版本 >= `1.5.0`。已测试的版本：
    - [x] 1.5.x
    - [x] 1.6.x

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "主机安装"

    进入 DataKit 安装目录下的 `conf.d/db` 目录，复制 `memcached.conf.sample` 并命名为 `memcached.conf`。示例如下：
    
    ```toml
        
    [[inputs.memcached]]
      ## Servers' addresses.
      servers = ["localhost:11211"]
      # unix_sockets = ["/var/run/memcached.sock"]
    
      ## Set true to enable election
      election = true
    
      ## Collect extra stats
      # extra_stats = ["slabs", "items"]
    
      ## Collect interval.
      # 单位 "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"
      interval = "10s"
    
    [inputs.memcached.tags]
      # some_tag = "some_value"
      # more_tag = "some_other_value"
      # ...
    
    ```

    配置好后，[重启 DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service) 即可。

=== "Kubernetes"

    目前可以通过 [ConfigMap 方式注入采集器配置](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting)来开启采集器。

## 指标 {#metric}

以下所有数据采集，默认会追加名为 `host` 的全局 tag（tag 值为 DataKit 所在主机名），也可以在配置中通过 `[inputs.memcached.tags]` 指定其它标签：

``` toml
 [inputs.memcached.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```
